Alternate configure utility - configure-alt
-------------------------------------------

Copy the file "configure-alt" as "configure", the file "build-alt" 
as "build" and the file test-memorymodel.c to the main distribution 
directory. The original "configure' coming in the distribution, 
it is used to discover the platform, but this alternate configure script
utility also discovers the default memory model and produces and appropiate 
makefile_configure, which then can be used to compile for the platform. 
The makefile will be done for the default memory model on the platform. 
Note that platforms may offer more than one memory model for compliling linking. 

Do a ./configure --help to see all the extra options and default overwrites.

The presets are lib readline and UTF-8 support and the default memory model
discovered.

The full command sequence to make newLISP with this tool is:

    ./confgure
    make -f makefile_configure

After this the build can be tested doing:

    make check

To trmove all files created buy configure and the compilation

    make distclean

This utility has not been tested much some flavors amd models and is still
in development.

Known pending issues: DEFAULT_OBJS are not the same for Win32 and OS2 as for UNIX
