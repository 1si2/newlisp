<h1>newLISP<font size=-2>&#174;</font> v.10.1 Release Notes 
<font size=-1 color="red">June 22nd, 2009</font></h1>

<p>Versions 10.0.2 to 10.0.8 are development releases leading up to this
stable release version 10.1.</p>

<h3>Improved support for concurrency and multi core CPUs</h3>
<p>Release 10.1 improves concurrency support for multi core CPUs with
new messaging functions for parent and child processes launched 
with <tt>spawn</tt>. The new non-blocking API works without locks and semaphores
and is safe against collisions.  Besides constants, any expression with any size
can be transferred with the new <tt>send</tt> and <tt>receive</tt> functions.
Objects bigger then the OS's shared memory pagesize are transferred using
files internally. The new message API is only available on Mac OS X, Linux and 
other UNIX.</p>

<h3>New and changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li><tt>dotree</tt> can filter hash symbols starting with an underscore character 
as used in hashes and <tt>bayes-train</tt> when using an optional <tt>true</tt> 
flag.</li><p>

<li><tt>expand</tt> when used with an association list as second parameter can now 
take an optional third boolean parameter to indicate evaluation of the value part 
in associations:</li>

<blockquote><pre>
(expand '(a b) '((a (+ 1 2)) (b (+ 3 4))) true) &rarr; (3 7)
</pre></blockquote>

<li><tt>expand</tt> and <tt>letex</tt> now also expand symbols on the top level
of an expression or letex body:</li>

<blockquote><pre>
(set 'x 123 'y 456)
(expand 'x 'x)          &rarr; 123 ; threw error before
(letex (x 'y) x)        &rarr; 456 ; returned y before
(letex (x '(+ 3 4)) x)  &rarr; 7   ; returned (+ 3 4) before
</pre></blockquote>

<li>Eliminated  stack-size dependence in functions <tt>find</tt> and <tt>map</tt>.</li><p>

<li>A new <tt>inf?</tt> predicate tests if a number is infinite:
<blockquote><pre>
(inf? (div 1 0)) &rarr; true
</pre></blockquote>
Before, a floating point division by zero would throw a "divsion by zero" error.</li>
<p>

<li><tt>lambda</tt> - functions now can be of unlimited length in their body without
affecting the runtime result-stack. Before the number of statements in a lambda
was limited to 2 to 4 thousand.</li><p>

<li>New <tt>last-error</tt> replaces eliminated <tt>error-number</tt> and 
<tt>error-text</tt> and returns number and text in a list consistent with the 
behavior of <tt>net-error</tt> and <tt>sys-error</tt>. All three functions now 
behave the same way and can enumerate all errors when given the error number 
as parameter.</li><p>

<li>The <tt>prob-z</tt> function is now implemented using the error function <tt>errf</tt>
and gives results with a higher precision.</li><p>

<li>The <tt>receive</tt> function receives a messge from a parent or child process
launched with <tt>spawn</tt>.</li><p> 

<li>The <tt>send</tt> functions sends a message to a parent or child process 
launched with <tt>spawn</tt>.</li><p>

<li>The <tt>share</tt> function now can share any lisp expression and size. On older versions
only boolean, number and strings constants were supported.</li><p>

<li>The function <tt>swap</tt> now can swap the contents of two places in lists,
arrays or variables specifying locations in the same form as done by the functions
<tt>setf</tt> or <tt>setq</tt> and <tt>inc</tt> or <tt>dec</tt>. The old syntax
of <tt>swap</tt> using three parameters has been eliminated. The new syntax also
allows swapping places from two different data objects. In the old form this was
only possible when swapping the contents of two variables. Now two elements from
two different lists or arrays can be swapped too:</li>

<blockquote><pre>
; swap places in one list
(set 'lst '(a b c d e f))
(swap (first lst) (last lst)) &rarr; a
lst                           &rarr; (f b c d e a)

; swap places in two lists
(set 'lst-b '(x y z))
(swap (lst 0) (lst-b -1)) &rarr; f
lst                       &rarr; (z b c d e a)
lst-b                     &rarr; (x y f)

(set 'lst '((a 1 2 3) (b 10 20 30)))
(swap (lookup 'a lst -1) (lookup 'b lst 1))
lst &rarr; ((a 1 2 10) (b 3 20 30))
</pre></blockquote>

<li>The function <tt>sys-info</tt> now also returns the process id (pid) of the 
parent process which launched the current process using <tt>fork</tt> or <tt>spawn</tt>.
The pid is 0 (zero) if newLISP was launched not from <tt>fork</tt> or <tt>spawn</tt>.
The pid can be found at position -4. It is recommended to access the last
four members with negative offsets, to be compatible with older versions of 
newLISP.</li><p>

<li>The function <tt>write-buffer</tt> now behaves like <tt>write-line</tt>. When
no parameters are given the contents of <tt>(current-line)</tt> line is written
to <em>stdout</em>. Whithout the second parameter the contents of <tt>(current-line)</tt>
is written to either the string buffer or file handle sepcified in the first 
parameter.</li><p>

<li>The new <tt>xfer-event</tt> function monitors byte-transfer in <tt>get-url</tt>, 
<tt>post-url</tt> and <tt>put-url</tt> and in all file operations which take URLs:</li>

<blockquote><pre>
(xfer-event (fn (n) (println "-&gt;" n)))

(length (get-url "http://newlisp.org"))
<b>-&gt;10240
-&gt;11221
11221</b>
</pre></blockquote>

</ul>

<h3>Changes and additions in external files</h3>

<ul>
<li>The MySQL interface using the <tt>mysql.lsp</tt> module file has been
ovehauled and the <tt>mysql5.lsp</tt> and <tt>mysql51.lwp</tt> module
files have been eliminated. The new <tt>mysql.lsp</tt> should be version
independent for versions including and after 4.0.</li><p>

<li>A new <tt>postgres.lsp</tt> interfaces to the PostSQL database.</li><p>

<li>The SQLite <tt>sqlite3.lsp</tt> module has been expanded with parameter binding
fucntionality for safer ussage of the database in web applications, where the 
danger of SQL injection exists.</li><p>

<li>All three modules <tt>mysql.lsp</tt>, <tt>postgres.lsp</tt> and <tt>sqlite3.lsp</tt>
have also been tested on 64-Bit newLISP.</li><p>

<li>The documentation utility <tt>newlispdoc</tt> now accepts custom tags. Any line starting
with <tt>;; @mytag my description</tt> will be formatted like any other tag line,
but has no effect other wise.</li><p>

<li>In the newLISP-GS editor newlisp-edit(.lsp) in both the editor and the monitor pane,
font face and size now can be changed interactively.</li><p>

<li>Added makefiles for 64-bit BSD, tested on OpenBSD.</li><p>

<li>When installing using <tt>make install</tt> or when installing from the UBUNTU Linux binary 
installer, a newlisp-x.x.x and a symbolic link is created for newlisp &rarr; newlisp.x.x.x, 
where x.x.x is the version number. This older versions of the newLISP binary are not deleted
and are still accessible. The binary installers for Win32 and Mac OS X have not changed.</li><p>

<li>When building newLISP on Mac OS X or other Unix, <tt>make check</tt> is now recognized 
additionally to <tt>make test</tt> and <tt>make all check</tt> will make and test.</p>
</ul>

<center>&sect;</center>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><tt>bind</tt> did not allow for recursive-incremental definitions.</li><p>

<li>The definition of <tt>legal?</tt> for symbols was too restrictive and caused
longer code than necessary when serializing symbols using <tt>save</tt> or 
<tt>source</tt></li><p>

<li>Some HTTP errors where not registered in <tt>net-error</tt>.</li><p>

<li>An unknown host result with <tt>net-lookup</tt> is now register with 
<tt>net-error</tt>. </li><p>

<li><tt>pack</tt> did no convert from floats (doubles) to integers only from
integers to floats. Now <tt>pack</tt> will correctly convert in both directions.
</li><p>

<li>The <tt>replace</tt> in remove mode did not work correctly when all list
members where <tt>nil</tt>.</li><p>

<li>Under some circumstances <tt>nil</tt> and <tt>true</tt> could confuse
the <tt>sort</tt> and <tt>unique</tt> functions.</li><p>

<li>The floating point division zero by zero and subtracting two infinite numbers
from each other will now return <tt>NaN</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
(NaN? (div 0 0)) &rarr; true

(set 'infinite (div 1 0))
(NaN? (sub infinite infinite)) &rarr; true
</pre></blockquote></li><p>

<li>Fixed a memory mapping problem surfacing on IBM AIX compiled newLISP.</li><p>

<li>Better handling of status in HTTP headers sent back from newLISP server mode.</li>
</ul>
