<h1>newLISP<font size=-2>&#174;</font> v.10.3.4 Development Release<font color="red" size="-1">rev 2011-10-05</font></h1>

<p>Version 10.3.4 is a development release with a reworked message interface.</p>

<h3>Addtions and changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A reworked <tt>send</tt>, <tt>receive</tt> message API is multiple times faster 
and has consistent performance on different OS platforms. The channel for each 
child is now a dual read/write message queue using Unix, local domain sockets
internally. In previous version only one message could be written with <tt>send</tt>. 
Now mutiple message can be placed into a message queue on the same channel and retrieved 
on the receiving side with multiple <tt>receive</tt> statements until returning 
<tt>nil</tt>, when the queue is empty. On the sending side <tt>send</tt> will return
<tt>nil</tt>, when the queue is full.<br/><br/>
New syntax forms for <tt>send </tt> and <tt>receive</tt> let the parent process 
filter child PIDs to target only those child processes, which are either ready to 
receive or target those from which messages can be be read. The <tt>(send)</tt> form 
allows the parent process to filter all those child PIDs, which are ready to receive 
messages sent by the parent. The <tt>(receive)</tt> form returns a list of child 
PIDs ready with messages in their sending queues to be read by the parent process.
<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A longstanding bug for ithe list-mode of <tt>net-select</tt> has been
fixed. Now, <tt>net-select</tt> <u>does</u> return socket numbers in the ready 
list not 0's (zeros).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>This version if fully compatible with the previous stable release version 10.3.3.</p>
