(1) WIN32 BINARY DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------

The Win32 binary distribution comes packed asa Win32 installer
application. After downloading a file:

    newlisp-xxxx-win-gs-xxx.exe

double click on the downloaded file and follow instructtions. xxxx and xxx 
are the version numbers for newLISP and the newLISP-GS the GUI frontend. 
On Win32 a ASCII version of newlisp.exe capable of ISO/IEC 8859 code pages 
is installed. A UTF-8 capable version is available from the newlisp download 
directory at: http://www.newlisp.org/downloads/UTF-8_win32/


(2) Mac OS X BINARY DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------

After downloading double-click on the Mac OS X disk image file:

    newlisp-xxxx-ppc.dmg     # for older PPC type Macs
or
    newlisp-xxxx-intel.dmg
    
This installs an applications icon in the Mac OS X Applications folder.
On Mac OS X a UTF-8 capable version is installed by default.


(3) UBUNTU Linux DEBIAN DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------

Double click the file:

    newlisp-xxxx-x_i386.deb
or
    newlisp-xxxx-utf8_i386.deb
    
This will bring up the debian installer application.


(4) MINIMUM INSTALL
-------------------

For a minumum install only the executable file: newlisp (or newlisp.exe on Win32)
needs to be moved to a directory in the executable path, i.e. /usr/bin/newlisp
or ~/bin in the home directory. No other files are required. All functionality


To reduce an exisiting UNIX install to a minimum installation, remove all files
in /usr/share/newlisp and /usr/share/doc/newlisp and the executable files
/usr/bin/newlisp-edit and /usr/bin/newlispdoc.

On Mac OX X remove also the files under the Applications icon in the Applications
folder. On Windows remove all file except newlisp.exe in C:/Program Files/newlisp.


(5) BUILD newLISP FROM SOURCE AND INSTALL ON ALL UNIX
-----------------------------------------------------

Un-tar/gunzip the distribution file newlisp_9.x.x.tgz :

    tar xzvf newlisp_9.x.x.tgz

Change the current directory in to newlisp_x.x.x/

and check what OS flavor make would detect, type:

    ./configure

This will automatically detect the platforms Linus, MacOS X, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, NetBSD and SunOS/Solaris.

If you agree with the platform detected by configure type:

    make
    
After building has finished type:

    make check

when all tests are passed OK do a

    sudo make install
    
or if already in superuser mode:

    make install
    

(6) COMMENTS FOR COMPILING AND LINKING
--------------------------------------

There are many other flavors for different OS and compilers type
make with help to see all options: 

    make help

If 'make' comes back with error messages try gmake, or any other 
make compatible with gmake.

to remove objects and before switching make flavors:

    make clean

A makefile for a specific platform and flavor can also be used explicitly 
by typing:

    make -f makefile_xxxxxx
    
where xxxx is one of the many flavors available in many makefile included.

Some OS's and installations may not support 'readline' or support for
milli seconds resolution in the time functions or library import functionality.
See the options NANOSLEEP, READLINE and NOIMPORT in the makefile_xxx
for your platform and compilation flavor. When using the READLINE option
on some OSs the library options -lreadline and -lncurses or -ltermcap have
to be replaced. 'readline' support enables command line editing and key-word
expansion using the TAB-key. Study the makefile of your platform to see
what options are supported.

On Linux makefile_linux is without readline support, use make_debian instead
even on non-debian Linux to gain readline support.

On some platforms the warning message "ANSI does not support long long" will be
issued for every file compiled. This message can be discarded and does not occur
on newer versions of GCC. The 'long long' data type is not used anywhere in the 
newLISP source but part of some header files of the GCC installation.

The Linux version is without readline support by default, because readline
support does not come in the default install of many Linux distributions.

When creating Win32 versions read the file README_WIN32 first.


(7) LOCALIZATION
----------------

The PCRE Regular Expressions code can be localized to your country/language 
It comes with default character tables for English, but should work well
for other languages when using the UTF-8 version of newLISP. For correct working of 
other string functions in your country/language a localizable 'C' library/OS 
may have to be used. The names of newLISP functions can be localized during 
runtime without performance loss, (see newlisp_manual.html).

There are UTF-8 versions/makefiles available in the source distribution.
See the chapter about 'Customization, localization and UTF-8' in the manual.


(8) UNINSTALL
-------------

On Win32 use the uninstall application from the newlisp applications
menu.

On Mac OS X double click on the uninstall script in the diskimage of
the installer package.

On UBUNTU Linux execute:

    sudo dpkg -r newlisp

On all other UNIX to uninstall if installed with make install do:

    sudo make uninstall

or if installed with: make install_home

    make uninstall_home
    
To manually uninstall on Win32 remove all files in c:\Program files\newlisp

On Mac OS X and other UNIX remove all files in /usr/share/newlisp and
/usr/share/doc/newlisp and the executable files /usr/bin/newlisp,
/usr/bin/newliso-edit and /usr/bin/newlispdoc. On Mac OX X also remove
the newLISP icon in the Applications folder.

   
(8) RUNNING newLISP IN A SHELL OR CONSOLE WINDOW
------------------------------------------------

On all platforms simply execute:
 
    newlisp

On Win32 the execution path of newlisp.exe was added to the environment 
during installation. On all other platforms the newlisp binary is in 
/usr/bin/newlisp or when using the home install in $HOME/bin
where $HOME is the the home directory of the user taken from the environment
variable HOME.


(10) RUNNING THE newLISP-GS GRAPHICAL FRONTEND
----------------------------------------------

On Win32 and Mac OS X a Java based syntaxhighlighting editor is installed in
in the Applications menus. In other UNIX execute:
    
    newlisp-edit
 
from the command line in a terminal window.
The editor needs a Java runtime environment JRE version 1.5 as a minimum. 
In case it is not installed it can be obtained from http://java.sun.com .
