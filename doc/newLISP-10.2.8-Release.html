<h1>newLISP<font size=-2>&#174;</font> v.10.2.8 Release Notes <font color="red" size="-1">rev 2010-05-20</font></h1>

<p>Version 10.2.8 is a stable maintenance version of the 10.2 series of releases. 
It introduces a new <tt>net-packet</tt> functions, other minor API enhancements in 
network and other functions and fixes bugs.</p>

<p>If upgrading from versions previous to 10.2, pease read the 
<a href=http://www.newlisp.org/downloads/previous-release-notes/newLISP-10.2-Release.html>
10.2 Release notes</a></p>


<h3>Additions and improvements to networking functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new <tt>net-packet</tt> function can be used to inject custom configured
IP packets. The function is only available on UNIX like operating systems and
has been configued and tested for Mac OS X on PPC and Intel CPUs, UBUNTU Linux
on Intel CPUs and OpenBSD on Intel CPUs.</li>

<li>The <tt>net-connect</tt> function now has a timeout parameter. In older
versions connection timeout behavior was controlled by the OS. Now connection
timeout is under programmer control.</li>

<li>The timeout parameter in the web functions <tt>get-url</tt>, <tt>post-url</tt>,
<tt>put-url</tt> and <tt>delete-url</tt> now also controls the connection phase.
In older versions, it only controlled the processs after connecting. This gave
web functions the appearance of hanging when the target server was disconnected
or down. Now these functions already can timout during the connection phase.</li>

<li>The <tt>net-service</tt> function now works in both directions. Now port
number can be translated to service names too. In older versions only translation
from service names to port numbers was possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other changes and additions</h3>

<ul>
<li>The timing function <tt>time</tt> did overflow after 35 minutes in the
10.x generation of newLISP; now it can count to about 68 years.</li>

<li>Speedup of hash entry deleletion. No reference checks are made anymore
when deleting hash entries using <tt>(<hash-symbol> <str-token> nil)</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>find-all</tt> has improved behavior on looping conditions, where it
no will increment the search offset by 1. Looping conditions occur, when
regular expressions result in zero-length strings found. In previous
versions <tt>find-all</tt> did exit on looping conditions.</li>

<li>In MS Windows both URLs forms: <tt>file://C:/example.txt</tt> and 
<tt>file:///C:/example.txt</tt> are now valid.</li> 

<li>The <tt>save</tt> function has been made faster up to a factor of 10x.</li>

<li>OpenBSD 4.6 now added as a regular test environment additionally
to Mac OSX, FreeBSD, UBUNTU Linux, SunOs Sparc and Windows XP/7.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <tt>map</tt> function now handles short parameter lists in a consistent
manner when mapping string manipulating functions onto lists of strings.</li>

<li><tt>xml-parse</tt> with context option did not convert names of built-in
primitives.</li>

<li><tt>load</tt> in HTTP mode did not return to previous context, but always
went into MAIN.</li>

<li>On Win32 negative <tt>-Inf</tt> lost the sign when converting to the
maximum integer value.</li>

<li>The <tt>true</tt> flag in <tt>delete</tt> was not handled correctly 
since 10.2.0.</li>

<li>In <tt>get-url</tt> the <tt>"list-debug"</tt> option did return a string 
instead of a list.</li>

<li>The <tt>find</tt> function accepted the regex option number only as
a constant.</li>
</ul>
