<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>When programming in newLISP certain functions and usage patterns occur repeatedly. For some problems an optimal way to solve them evolves over time. The following chapters present example code and explanations for the solution of specific problems when programming in newLISP.</p>

<p>Some content is overlapping with material covered in the newLISP Users Manual and Reference or presented here with a different slant.</p>

<p>Only a subset of newLISP's total function repertoire is used here. Some functions demonstrated have additional calling patterns or applications not mentioned on these pages.</p>

<p>This collection of patterns and solutions is a work in progress. Over time material will be added or existing material improved.</p>

<center>&sect;</center>

<a name="scripts"></a>
<h2>2. newLISP script files</h2>

<h3>Specifying command line options in script files</h3>
<p>On Linux/UNIX put the following in the first line of the script/program file:</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp
</pre>

<p>specifying a bigger stack: </p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp -s 100000
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp -s100000
</pre>

<p>Operating systems shells behave differently when parsing the first line and extract parameters. newLISP takes both, attached or detached parameters. Put the following lines in small script to test the behavior of the underlying OS and platform. The script changes the stack size allocated to 100,000 and limits LISP cell memory to about 10 M bytes.</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp -s 100000 -m 10

    (println (main-args))
    (println (sys-info))
</pre>

<p>A typical output executing the script from the system shell would be:</p>

<pre>
    ./arg-test
    
    ("/usr/bin/newlisp" "-s" "100000" "-m" "10" "./arg-test")    
    (308 655360 299 2 0 100000 8410 2)
</pre>

<p>Note that few programs in newLISP need a bigger stack configured, most programs run on the internal default of 2048. Each stack position takes an average of 80 bytes. Other options are available to start newLISP. See the Users Manual for details.</p>

<h3>Scripts as pipes</h3>

<pre>
    The following examples shows how a file can be piped into a newLISP script.
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp
    #
    # uppercase - demo filter script as pipe
    #
    # usage: 
    #          ./uppercase &lt; file-spec
    #
    # example: 
    #          ./uppercase &lt; my-text
    #
    #

    (while (read-line) (println (upper-case (current-line))))

    (exit)
</pre>


<p>The file will be printed to <em>std-out</em> translated to uppercase.</p>

<h3>File filters</h3>

<p>The following script works like a Unix <em>grep</em> utility iterating through files and filtering each line in a file using a regular expression pattern.</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp
    #
    # nlgrep - grep utility on newLISP
    #
    # usage: 
    #          ./nlgrep "regex-pattern" file-spec
    #
    # file spec can contain globbing characters
    #
    # example: 
    #          ./nlgrep "this|that" *.c
    #
    # will print all line containing 'this' or 'that' in *.c files
    #

    (dolist (file-name (3 (main-args))) 
        (set 'file (open file-name "read"))
        (println "file ---> " file-name)
        (while (read-line file)
            (if (find (main-args 2) (current-line) 0)
            	(write-line)))
        (close file))
                
    (exit)
</pre>

<p>The expression:</p>
<pre>
    (3 (main-args))
</pre>

<p>is a short form of writing:</p>

<pre>
    (rest (rest (rest (main-args))))
</pre>

<p>It returns a list of all the filenames. This form of specifying indexes for rest is called 
implicit indexing. See the Users Manual for implicit indexing with other functions.
The expression <tt>(main-args 2)</tt> extracts the 3rd argument from the command line containing the regular expression pattern.</p>

<a name="modules"></a>
<h2>3. Writing software in modules</h2>

<h3>Structuring an application</h3>

<p>When writing bigger applications or when several programmers are working on the same code base it is necessary to divide the code base into modules. Modules in newLISP are implemented using contexts, which are namespaces. Namespaces allow lexical isolation between modules. Variables of the same name in one module cannot clash with variables of the same name in another module.</p>

<p>Typically modules will be organized in one context per file. One file module may contain database access routines.</p>

<pre>
    ; database.lsp
    ;
    (context 'db)
    
    
    (define (update x y z)
    ...
    )
    
    (define (erase x y z)
    ...
    )
</pre>

<p>Another module may contain various utilities</p>

<pre>
    ; auxiliary.lsp
    ;
    (context 'aux)
    
    (define (getval a b)
    ...
    )
</pre>

<p>Typically there will be one MAIN module loading and controlling all others:</p>

<pre>
    ; application.lsp
    ;
    
    (load "auxiliary.lsp")
    (load "database.lsp")
    
    (define (run)
        (db:update ....)
        (aux:putval ...)
        ...
        ...
    )
    
    (run)
</pre>

<h3>More than one context per file</h3>

<p>When using more than one context per file, each context section should be closed with a <tt>(context MAIN)</tt> statement:</p>

<pre>
    ; myapp.lsp
    ;
    (context 'A)
    
    (define (foo ...) ...)
    
    (context MAIN)
    
    (context 'B)
    
    (define (bar ...) ...)
    
    (context MAIN)
    
    (define (main-func)
        (A:foo ...)
        (B:bar ...)
    )
</pre>

<p>Note that in the namespace statements for contexts <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> the context names are quoted because they are newly created, while <tt>MAIN</tt> already exists when newLISP starts up and can stay unquoted, although quoting it would not represent a problem.</p>

<p>To save the line closing the context with <tt>MAIN</tt>, the following technique can be used:</p>

<pre>
    ; myapp.lsp
    ;
    (context 'A)
    
    (define (foo ...) ...)
    
    (context 'MAIN:B)
    
    (define (bar ...) ...)
   
    (context 'MAIN)
 
    (define (main-func)
        (A:foo ...)
        (B:bar ...)
    )
</pre>

<p>The line <tt>(context 'MAIN:B)</tt> switches back to MAIN then opens 
the new context <tt>B</TT>.</p>

<h3>Simple objects and the default function</h3>

<p>A function in a context may have the same name as the host context itself. This function has special characteristics:</p>

<pre>
    (context 'foo)
    
    (define (foo:foo a b c)
    ...
    )
</pre>

<p>The function <tt>foo:foo</tt> is called the <em>default function</em>, because when using the context name <tt>foo</tt> like a function it will default to <tt>foo:foo</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    (foo x y z)
    ; same as
    (foo:foo x y z)
</pre>

<p>The default function make is possible to write functions which look like normal functions but carry their own lexical namespace. We can use this to write functions which keep state:</p>

<pre>
    (context 'generator)
    
    (set 'acc 0)
    
    (define (generator:generator)
        (inc acc))
    
    (context MAIN)
    
    (generator) &rarr; 1
    (generator) &rarr; 2
    (generator) &rarr; 3
</pre>

<p>The following is a more complex example for a function generating a fibonacci sequence:</p>

<pre>
    (define (fibo:fibo)
        (if (not fibo:mem) (set 'fibo:mem '(0 1)))
        (last (push (+ (fibo:mem -1) (fibo:mem -2)) fibo:mem -1)))
    
    (fibo) &rarr; 1
    (fibo) &rarr; 2
    (fibo) &rarr; 3
    (fibo) &rarr; 5
    (fibo) &rarr; 8
    ...
</pre>

<p>This example also shows how a default function is defined <i>on the fly</i> without the need of explicit <tt>context</tt> statements. As an alternative the function could also have been written creating the context explicitly:</p>

<pre>
    (context 'fibo)
    (define (fibo:fibo)
            (if (not mem) (set 'mem '(0 1)))
            (last (push (+ (mem -1) (mem -2)) mem -1)))
    (context MAIN)
    
    (fibo) &rarr; 1
    (fibo) &rarr; 2
    (fibo) &rarr; 3
    (fibo) &rarr; 5
    (fibo) &rarr; 8
</pre>

<p>while the first form is shorter, the second form is more readable.</p>

<h3>Packaging data with contexts</h3>

<p>The previous examples already presented functions packaged with data in a namespace. In 
the <tt>generator</tt> example the <tt>acc</tt> variable kept state. In the <tt>fibo</tt> 
example the variable <tt>mem</tt> kept a growing list. In both cases functions and data are 
living together in a namespace. The following example shows how a namespace just holds data 
only in a  default functor:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'db:db '(a "b" (c d) 1 2 3 x y z))
</pre>

<p>Just like we used the default function to refer to <tt>fibo</tt> and <tt>generator</tt> we can refer to the list in <tt>db:db</tt> by only using <tt>db</tt>. This will work in all situations where we do list indexing:</p>

<pre>
    (db 0)    &rarr; a
    (db 1)    &rarr; "b"
    (db 2 1)  &rarr; d
    (db -1)   &rarr; z
    (db -3)   &rarr; x
 
    (3 db)    &rarr; (1 2 3 x y z)
    (2 1 db)  &rarr; ((c d))
    (-6 2 db) &rarr; (1 2)
</pre>

<h3>Passing context objects by reference</h3>

<p>The default functor when used as an argument in a user defined function, is passed by reference. That means that no copy of the list or string is passed but a reference to the original contents. This is useful when handling large lists or strings:</p>

<pre>
    (define (update data idx expr)
        (if (not (or (lambda? expr) (primitive? expr)))
            (setf (data idx) expr)
            (setf (data idx) (expr $it))))
        
    (update db 0 99) &rarr; a
    db:db &rarr; (99 "b" (c d) 1 2 3 x y z)
    
    (update db 1 upper-case) &rarr; "b"
    db:db &rarr; (99 "B" (c d) 1 2 3 x y z)
    
    (update db 4 (fn (x) (mul 1.1 x))) &rarr;
    db:db &rarr; (99 "B" (c d) 1 2.2 3 x y z)
</pre>

<p>The data in <tt>db:db</tt> is passed via the <tt>update</tt> function parameter 
<tt>data</tt>, which now holds a reference to the context <tt>db</tt>. The <tt>expr</tt> 
parameter passed is checked if a built-in function, operator or a user defined lambda 
expression and than works on <tt>$it</tt>, the anaphoric system variable containing 
the old content referenced by <tt>(data idx)</tt>.</p>

<p>Whenever a function in newLISP asks for a string or list in a parameter, a default 
functor can be passed by its context symbol. Another example:</p>

<pre>
    (define (pop-last data)
    (pop data -1))

    (pop-last db) &rarr; z

    db:db         &rarr; (99 "B" (c d) 1 2.2 3 x y)
</pre>

<p>The function <tt>update</tt> is also a good example how to pass operators or functions 
as function argument (<tt>upper-case</tt> working on <tt>$it</tt>). Read more about this 
in chapter <a href="#functions">9. Functions as data</a>.</p>

<a name="locals"></a>
<h2>4. Local variables</h2> 

<h3>Locals in looping functions</h3>

<p>All looping functions like <tt>doargs</tt>, <tt>dolist</tt>, <tt>dostring</tt>, 
<tt>dotimes</tt>, <tt>dotree</tt> and <tt>for</tt>, use local variables. During 
loop execution the variable takes different values, but after leaving the looping 
function the variable regains its old value. <tt>let</tt>, <tt>define</tt>, and 
<tt>lambda</tt> expressions are another method for making variables local:</p>

<h3>Local symbols using <tt>let</tt>, <tt>letn</tt> and <tt>local</tt></h3>

<p><tt>let</tt> is the usual way in LISP to declare symbols as local to a block.</p>
<pre>
    (define (sum-sq a b)
        (let ((x (* a a)) (y (* b b)))
            (+ x y)))

    (sum-sq 3 4) &rarr; 25

    ; alternative syntax
    (define (sum-sq a b)         
        (let (x (* a a) y (* b b))
            (+ x y)))

    ; using local
    (define (sum-sq a b)
        (local (x y)
            (set 'x (* a a))
            (set 'y (* b b))
            (+ x y)))
</pre>

<p>The variables x and y are initialized, then the expression (+ x y) is evaluated. The <tt>let</tt> form is just an optimized version and syntactic convenience for writing:</p>

<pre>
    ((lambda (sym1 [sym2 ...]) exp-body ) exp-init1 [ exp-init2 ...])
</pre>

<p>When initializing several parameters, a nested <tt>let</tt>, <tt>letn</tt> can be used to reference previously initialized variables in subsequent initializer expressions:</p>

<pre>
    (letn ((x 1) (y (+ x 1))) 
        (list x y))              &rarr; (1 2)
</pre>

<p>The function <tt>local</tt> works like a <tt>let</tt> but initializing all variables to <tt>nil</tt>.</p>

<h3>Unused parameters as local symbols</h3>

<p>In newLISP all parameters in user defined functions are optional. Unused parameters are filled with <tt>nil</tt> and local to the dynamic scope of the function. Defining a user function with more parameters than required is a convenient method to create local variable symbols:</p>

<pre>
    (define (sum-sq a b , x y)
        (set 'x (* a a))
        (set 'y (* b b))
        (+ x y))
</pre>

<p>The comma is not a special syntax feature but only a visual helper to separate normal parameters from local variable symbols.</p>

<h3>Default values for unfilled variables</h3>

<p>In the definition of a function default values can be specified:</p>

<pre>
    (define (foo (a 1) (b 2))
        (list a b))
    
        (foo)      &rarr;  (1 2)
        (foo 3)    &rarr;  (3 2)
        (foo 3 4)  &rarr;  (3 4)
</pre>

<h3>Using <tt>args</tt> as local substitute</h3>

<p>Using the <tt>args</tt> function no parameter symbols need to be used at all and <tt>args</tt> returns a list of all parameters passed but not taken by declared parameters:</p>

<pre>
    (define (foo)
        (args))
    
    (foo 1 2 3)   &rarr; (1 2 3)
    
    
    (define (foo a b)
        (args))
    
    (foo 1 2 3 4 5)   &rarr; (3 4 5)
</pre>

<p>The second example shows how <tt>args</tt> only contains the list of arguments not bound by the variable symbols <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.</p>

<p>Indices can be used to access members of the <tt>(args)</tt> list:</p>

<pre>
    (define (foo) 
          (+ (args 0) (args 1)))
      
    (foo 3 4)   &rarr; 7 
</pre>

<h3>Named parameters using <tt>bind</tt></h3>

<p><tt>bind</tt> can also be used together with <tt>local</tt> and <tt>args</tt> 
to write functions with named parameters:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
(define-macro (foo) 
    (local (len width height)
        (bind (args) true)
        (println "len:" len " width:" width " height:" height)
))


<b>&gt;</b> (foo (width (+ 15 5)) (height 30) (len 10))
<b>len:10 width:20 height:30</b>

<b>&gt;</b> (foo (width (+ 15 5)) (height (* width 2)) (len 10))
<b>len:10 width:20 height:40</b>

<b>&gt;</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Arguments are evaluated incrementally in the local environment and assigned to 
the local variables.</p>

<h2>5. Walking through lists</h2>

<h3>Recursion or iteration?</h3>

<p>Although recursion is a powerful feature to express many algorithms in a readable form, they are also inefficient in some instances. newLISP has many iterative constructs and high level functions like <tt>flat</tt> or the built-in XML functions, which use recursion internally. In many cases this makes defining a recursive algorithm not necessary.</p>


<p>Some times a non-recursive solution can be much faster and lighter on system resources.</p>

<pre>
    ;; classic recursion
    ;; slow and resource hungry
     (define (fib n)
        (if (< n 2) 1
            (+  (fib (- n 1))
            (fib (- n 2)))))
</pre>

<p>The recursive solution is slow because of frequent calling overhead incurs. The recursive solution uses also a lot of memory for holding intermediate results and frequently redundant resuls.</p>

<pre>    
    ;; iteration
    ;; fast and also returns the whole list
    (define (fibo n , f)
        (set 'f '(1 0))
        (dotimes (i n)
             (push (+ (f 0) (f 1)) f)) )
</pre>

<p>The iterative solution is fast and uses very little memory.</p>

<h3>Generators</h3>

<p>A generator is a function which keeps and changed state between invocations and returns a new value on each call:</p>

<pre>
    ;; generator uses a namespace to keep state
    ;; the default funcion (fibo) gets called repeatedly
    ;;
    ;; (fibo) &rarr; 1
    ;; (fibo) &rarr; 2
    ;; (fibo) &rarr; 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 ...
    ;;
    ;; fibo:mem &rarr; (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...)
    (define (fibo:fibo)
        (if (not fibo:mem) (set 'fibo:mem '(0 1))) 
        (last (push (+ (fibo:mem -2) (fibo:mem -1)) fibo:mem -1)))
</pre>

<p>Namespaces in newLISP together with default functions are a convenient method to 
package a function with local static variables. <tt>mem</tt> is used in the <tt>fibo</tt> 
name space to keep the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<h3>Speed up with memoization</h3>

<p>A memoizing function caches results for faster retrieval when called with the 
same parameters again. The following function makes a memoizing function
from any built-in or user defined function with an arbitrary number of arguments:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
;; speed up a recursive function using memoization
(define-macro (memoize mem-func func) 
  (set (sym mem-func mem-func) 
    (letex (f func  c mem-func) 
      (lambda () 
        (or (context c (string (args))) 
            (context c (string (args)) (apply f (args))))))))

(define (fibo n)
  (if (< n 2) 1
      (+  (fibo (- n 1))
          (fibo (- n 2)))))
                                 
(memoize fibo-m fibo)

(time (fibo-m 25)) &rarr; 148
(time (fibo-m 25)) &rarr; 0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The function  creates a context and <em>default</em> function for the original
function with a new name and stores all results in symbols in the same context.</p>

<p>When memoizing recursive functions, include the the raw lambda specification
of the function so recursive calls are memoized too:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
(memoize fibo
  (lambda (n)
    (if(< n 2) 1
      (+  (fibo (- n 1))
          (fibo (- n 2))))))

(time (fibo 100)) &rarr; 1
(fibo 80)         &rarr; 37889062373143906
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt>fibo</tt> function in the last example would take hours to calculate
without memoization. The memoized version takes only about a milli-second for
an argument of <tt>100</tt>.</p>

<h3>Walking a tree</h3>

<p>Tree walks are a typical pattern in traditional LISP and in newLISP as well 
for walking through a nested list. But many times a tree walk is only used to 
iterate through all elements of an existing tree or nested list. In this case 
the built-in <tt>flat</tt> function is much faster than using recursion:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'L '(a b c (d e (f g) h i) j k))

    ;; classic car/cdr and recursion
    ;; 
    (define (walk-tree tree)
        (cond ((= tree '()) true)
               ((atom? (first tree))
                 (println (first tree)) 
                 (walk-tree (rest tree)))
               (true
                 (walk-tree (first tree)) 
                 (walk-tree (rest tree)))))

    ;; classic recursion
    ;; 3 times faster
    ;;
    (define (walk-tree tree)
        (dolist (elmnt tree)
              (if (list? elmnt) 
              (walk-tree elmnt)
              (println elmnt))))
      
    (walk-tree L) &rarr;
    a
    b
    c
    d
    e
    ...
</pre>

<p>Using the built-in <tt>flat</tt> in newLISP a nested list can be transformed int a flat list. Now the list can be processed with a <tt>dolist</tt> or <tt>map</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    ;; fast and short using 'flat'
    ;; 30 times faster with map
    ;;
    (map println (flat L))

    (dolist (item (flat L)) (println item)
</pre>


<h3>Walking a directory tree</h3>
<p>Walking a directory tree is a task where recursion works well:</p>

<pre>
    ; walks a disk directory and prints all path-file names
    ;
    (define (show-tree dir)
    (if (directory dir)
        (dolist (nde (directory dir))
           (if (and (directory? (append dir "/" nde)) 
                    (!= nde ".") (!= nde ".."))
                 (show-tree (append dir "/" nde))
                 (println (append dir "/" nde))))))
</pre>

<p>In this example recursion is the only solution, because the entire nested list off files is not available when the function is called but gets created recursively during function execution.</p>

<a name="creating"></a>
<h2>6. Creating, accessing, modifying and searching lists</h2>

<p>newLISP has facilities for multidimensional indexing into nested lists. There are 
<i>destructive</i> functions like <tt>push</tt>, <tt>pop</tt>, <tt>setf</tt>, 
<tt>set-ref</tt>, <tt>set-ref-all</tt>, <tt>sort</tt> and <tt>reverse</tt> and many others for 
<i>non-destructive</i> operations, like <tt>nth</tt>, <tt>ref</tt>, <tt>ref-all</tt>,
<tt>first</tt>, <tt>last</tt> and <tt>rest</tt> etc.. 
Many of the list functions in newLISP also work on strings.</p>

<p>Note that any list or string index in newLISP can be negative starting with -1 
from the right side of a list:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'L '(a b c d))
    (L -1)   &rarr; d
    (L -2)   &rarr; c
    (-3 2 L) &rarr; (b c)

    (set 'S  "abcd")

    (S -1)   &rarr; d
    (S -2)   &rarr; c
    (-3 2 S) &rarr; "bc")
</pre>


<h3><tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt></h3>

<p>To add to a list use <tt>push</tt>, to eliminate an element from a list use <tt>pop</tt>. 
Both functions are destructive, changing the contents of a list:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'L '(b c d e f))

    (push 'a L) &rarr; (a b c d e f)
    (push 'g L -1) ;; push at the end with negative index
    (pop L) ; pop first a
    (pop L -1) ; pop last g
    (pop L -2) ; pop second to last e
    (pop L 1)  ; pop second c
	
	L &rarr; (b d f)

    ; multidimensional push / pop
    (set 'L '(a b (c d (e f) g) h i))
    
    (push 'x L 2 1) &rarr; (a b (c x d (e f) g) h i)
    
    L &rarr; (a b (c x d (e f) g) h i)
    
    (pop L 2 1) &rarr; x 
</pre>

<p>Pushing to the end of a list repeatedly is optimized in newLISP and as fast as 
pushing in front of a list.</p>

<p>When pushing an element with index vector V it can be popped with the same index vector V:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'L '(a b (c d (e f) g) h i))
    (set 'V '(2 1))
    (push 'x L V)
    L &rarr; (a b (c x d (e f) g) h i))
    (ref 'x L) &rarr; (2 1) ; search for a nested member
    (pop L V) &rarr; 'v
</pre>

<h3>Accessing lists</h3>

<p>Multiple indexes can be specified to access elements in a nested list structure:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'L '(a b (c d (e f) g) h i))

    ; old syntax only for one index
    (nth 2 L) &rarr; (c d (e f) g)

    ; use new syntax for multiple indices
    (nth '(2 2 1) L) &rarr; f
    (nth '(2 2) L) &rarr; (e f)

    ; vector indexing
    (set 'vec '(2 2))
    (nth vec L) &rarr; (e f)

    ; implicit indexing
    (L 2 2 1) &rarr; f
    (L 2 2)   &rarr; (e f)

    ; implicit indexing with vector
    (set 'vec '(2 2 1))
    (L vec)   &rarr; f
</pre>

<p>Implicit indexing shown in the last example cane make code more readable. 
Indexes before a list select subsections of a list, which in turn are always lists.</p>

<p>Implicit indexing is also available for rest and slice:</p>

<pre>
    (rest '(a b c d e))      &rarr; (b c d e)
    (rest (rest '(a b c d e) &rarr; (c d e)
    ; same as
    (1 '(a b c d e)) &rarr; (b c d e)
    (2 '(a b c d e)) &rarr; (c d e)
    
    ; negative indices
    (-2 '(a b c d e)) &rarr; (d e)

    ; slicing
    (2 2 '(a b c d e f g))  &rarr; (c d)
    (-5 3 '(a b c d e f g)) &rarr; (c d e)
</pre>

<h3>Selecting more than one element</h3>
<p>Sometimes more than one element must be selected from a list.
This is done using select:</p>

<pre>
    ;; pick several elements from a list
    (set 'L '(a b c d e f g))
    (select L 1 2 4 -1) &rarr; (b c e g)

    ;; indices can be delivered in an index vector:
    (set 'vec '(1 2 4 -1))
    (select L vec) &rarr; (b c e g)
</pre>

<p>The selecting process can re-arrange or double elements at the same time:</p>

<pre>
    (select L 2 2 1 1) &rarr; (c c b b)
</pre>

<h3>Filtering and differencing lists</h3>

<p>Sometimes lists need to be filterer for a specific conditions applied to its elements:</p>

<pre>
    (filter (fn(x) (&lt; 5 x)) '(1 6 3 7 8))    &rarr; (6 7 8)
    (filter symbol? '(a b 3 c 4 "hello" g)) &rarr; (a b c g)
    (difference '(1 3 2 5 5 7) '(3 7)) &rarr; (1 2 5)
</pre>

<p>The first example could be rewritten shorter as follows:</p>

<pre>
    (filter (curry &lt; 5) '(1 6 3 7 8))
</pre>

<p>The <tt>curry</tt> function makes a one-argument function out of a two argument
function:</p>

<pre>
    (curry &lt; 5) &rarr; (lambda (_x) (&lt; 5 _x))
</pre>

<p>Using <tt>curry</tt> a function taking two arguments quickly is converted into
a predicate taking one argument.</p> 

<h3>Changing list elements</h3>

<p><tt>setf</tt> can be used to change a list element by referencing it with either
<tt>nth</tt> or <tt>assoc</tt>:</p>

<pre>
	; modify a list
    (set 'L '(a b (c d (e f) g) h i))
    
    (setf (L 2 2 1) 'x) &rarr; x
    
    L &rarr; (a b (c d (e x) g) h i)
    
    
    ; modify an association list
    (set 'A '((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)))
    
    (setf (assoc 'b A) '(b 222)) &rarr; (b 222)
    
    A &rarr; ((a 1) (b 222) (c 3))

</pre>

<h3>The new element as a function of the replaced</h3>

<p>The internal <em>anaphoric</em> system variable <tt>$it</tt> holds the old list element. 
This can be used to configure the new one:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'L '(0 0 0))
    (setf (L 1) (+ $it 1)) &rarr; 1 ; the new value
    (setf (L 1) (+ $it 1)) &rarr; 2
    (setf (L 1) (+ $it 1)) &rarr; 4
    L &rarr; '(0 3 0)
    </pre>


<h3>Search and replace in simple lists</h3>

<p>Replace, which can also be used on strings, can search for and replace
multiple elements in a list at once. Together with <tt>match</tt> and <tt>unify</tt>
complex search patterns can be specified. Like with <tt>setf</tt>, the replacement 
expression can use the old element contents to form the replacement.</p>

<pre>
    (set 'aList '(a b c d e a b c d))

    (replace 'b aList 'B) &rarr; (a B c d e a B c d)
</pre>

<p>The function <tt>replace</tt> can take a comparison function for picking
list elements:</p>
 
<pre>
    ; replace all numbers where 10 &lt; number
    (set 'L '(1 4 22 5 6 89 2 3 24))

    (replace 10 L 10 &lt;) &rarr; (1 4 10 5 6 10 2 3 10)
</pre>

<p>Using the built-in functions <tt>match</tt> and <tt>unify</tt> more complex selection
criteria can be defined:</p>

<pre>
    ; replace only sublists starting with 'mary'

    (set 'AL '((john 5 6 4) (mary 3 4 7) (bob 4 2 7 9) (jane 3)))

    (replace '(mary *)  AL (list 'mary (apply + (rest $it))) match)
    &rarr; ((john 5 6 4) (mary 14) (bob 4 2 7 9) (jane 3))

    ; make sum in all expressions

    (set 'AL '((john 5 6 4) (mary 3 4 7) (bob 4 2 7 9) (jane 3)))

    (replace '(*) AL (list ($it 0) (apply + (rest $it))) match)
    &rarr; ((john 15) (mary 14) (bob 22) (jane 3))

    $0 &rarr; 4  ; replacements made

    ; change only sublists where both elements are the same

    (replace '(X X) '((3 10) (2 5) (4 4) (6 7) (8 8)) (list ($it 0) 'double ($it 1)) unify)
    &rarr; ((3 10) (2 5) (4 double 4) (6 7) (8 double 8))

    $0 &rarr; 2  ; replacements made
</pre>

<p>During replacements <tt>$0</tt> and the anaphoric system variable <tt>$it</tt>
contain the current found expression.</p>

<p>After a replacement statement is executed the newLISP system variable <tt>$0</tt>
contains the number of replacements made.</p>

<h3>Search and replace in nested lists</h3>

<p>Sometimes lists are nested, e.g. the SXML results fropm parsing XML. The functions
<tt>ref-set</tt>, <tt>set-ref</tt> and <tt>set-ref-all</tt> can be used to find and
replace a single or all element in a nested list and replace it or all.</p>

<pre>
    (set 'data '((monday (apples 20 30) (oranges 2 4 9)) (tuesday (apples 5) (oranges 32 1))))

    (set-ref 'monday data tuesday) 
    &rarr; ((tuesday (apples 20 30) (oranges 2 4 9)) (tuesday (apples 5) (oranges 32 1)))
</pre>

<p>The function <tt>set-ref-all</tt> does a <tt>set-ref</tt> multiple times, replacing all
found occurrences of and element.</p>

<pre>
    (set 'data '((monday (apples 20 30) (oranges 2 4 9)) (tuesday (apples 5) (oranges 32 1))))

    (set-ref-all 'apples data "Apples") 
    &rarr; ((monday ("Apples" 20 30) (oranges 2 4 9)) (tuesday ("Apples" 5) (oranges 32 1)))
</pre>

<p>Like <tt>find</tt>, <tt>replace</tt>, <tt>ref</tt> and <tt>ref-all</tt>, more
complex searches can be expressed using <tt>match</tt> or <tt>unify</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'data '((monday (apples 20 30) (oranges 2 4 9)) (tuesday (apples 5) (oranges 32 1))))

    (set-ref-all '(oranges *) data (list (first $0) (apply + (rest $it))) match)	
    &rarr; ((monday (apples 20 30) (oranges 15)) (tuesday (apples 5) (oranges 33)))
</pre>

<p>The last exampls shows how <tt>$0</tt> can be used to access the old list element
in the updating expression. In this case the numbers for <tt>oranges</tt> records
have been summed up. Instead of <tt>$0</tt> the anaphoric system variable <tt>$it</tt>
can also be used.</p>

<h3>Passing lists by reference using the default functor</h3>

<p>Sometimes a larger list (more than a few hundred elements) must passed to a 
userdefined function for changing elements in it. Normally newLISP passes all parameters 
to user-defined functions by value. The following snipped shows a technique that can 
be used to pass a bigger list or string object by reference:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'data:data '(a b c d e f g h))

    (define (change db i value)
        (setf (db i) value))

    (change data 3 999) &rarr; d
    
    data:data &rarr; '(a b c 999 d e f g h)
</pre>

<p>In this example the list is encapsulated in a context named <tt>data</tt> 
holding a variable <tt>data</tt> with the same name.</p>

<p>Whenever a function in newLISP looks for a string or list parameter, a 
context can be passed, which then will be interpreted as the default functor.</p>

<p>Many built-in functions when returning a list or array or an element belonging to
a list or array referenced by a symbol, return a reference to the list &ndash; not 
a copy. This can be used to nest built-in functions when modifying a list:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'L '(r w j s r b))

    (pop (sort L)) &rarr; b

    L &rarr; (j r r s w)
</pre>

<center>&sect;</center>

<a name="flow"></a>
<h2>7. Program flow</h2>

<p>Program flow in newLISP is mostly functional but it also has looping and branching constructs and a <tt>catch</tt> and <tt>throw</tt> to break out of the normal flow.</p>

<p>Looping expressions as a whole behave like a function or block returning the last expression evaluated. </p>

<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>Most of the traditional looping patterns are supported. Whenever there is a looping variable, it is local in scope to the loop, behaving according the rules of dynamic scoping inside the current name-space or context:</p>


<pre>
    ; loop a number of times
    ; i goes from 0 to N - 1
    (dotimes (i N)
       ....
    )
    
    ; demonstrate locality of i
    (dotimes (i 3) 
        (print i ":") 
        (dotimes (i 3) (print i))
        (println))
    
    &rarr; ; will output
    0:012
    1:012
    2:012
    
    ; loop through a list
    ; takes the value of each element in aList
    (dolist (e aList)
       ...
    )

    ; loop through a sring
    ; takes the ASCII or UTF-8 value of each character in aString
    (dostring (e aString)
       ...
    )
    
    ; loop through the symbols of a context in
    ; alphabetical order of the symbol name
    (dotree (s CTX)
       ...
    )
    
    ; loop from to with optional step size
    ; i goes from init to <= N inclusive with step size step
    ; Note that the sign in step is irrelevant, N can be greater
    ; or less then init.
    (for (i init N step)
       ...
    )
    
    ; loop while a condition is true
    ; first test condition then perform body
    (while condition
       ...
    )
    
    ; loop while a condition is false
    ; first test condition then perform body
    (until condition
       ....
    )
    
    ; loop while a condition is true
    ; first perform body then test
    ; body is performed at least once
    (do-while condition
      ...
    )
    
    ; loop while a condition is false
    ; first perform body then test
    ; body is performed at least once
    (do-until condition
      ...
    )
</pre>

<p>Note that the looping functions <tt>dolist</tt>, <tt>dotimes</tt> and <tt>for</tt> can also
take a break condition as an additional argument. When the break condition evaluates to true
the loop finishes:</p>

<pre>
    (dolist (x '(a b c d e f g) (= x 'e)) 
        (print x))
    &rarr; ; will output
    abcd
</pre>

<h3>Blocks</H3>
<p>Blocks are collections of s-expressions evaluated sequentially. All looping constructs may have expression blocks after the condition expression as a body.</p>

<p>Blocks can also be constructed by enclosing them in a begin expression:</p>

 <pre>
    (begin
        s-exp1
        s-exp2
        .....
        s-expN)
</pre>

<p>Looping constructs do not need to use an explicit begin after the looping conditions. <tt>begin</tt>
is mostly used to block expressions in <tt>if</tt> and <tt>cond</tt> statements.</p>

<p>The functions <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, <tt>let</tt>, <tt>letn</tt> and <tt>local</tt> 
can also be used to form blocks and do not require <tt>begin</tt> for blocking statements.</p>

<H3>Branching</H3>

<pre>
    (if condition true-expr false-expr)
     
    ;or when no false clause is present
    (if condition true-expr)

    ;or unary if for (filter if '(...))
    (if condition)  
    
    ;; more then one statement in the true or false
    ;; part must be blocked with (begin ...)
    (if (= x Y)
       (begin
          (some-func x)
          (some-func y)
       (begin
          (do-this x y)
          (do-that x y)))

    ; the when form can take several statements without
    ; using a (begin ...) block
    (when condition
        exp-1
        exp-2
        ...
    )

    ; if-not works like (if (not ...) ...)
    (if-not true-expr false-expr)

    ; unless works like (when (not ...) ...)
    (unless condition
        exp-1
        exp-2 
        ...
    )
</pre>

<p>Depending on condition the <tt>exp-true</tt> or <tt>exp-false</tt> part is evaluated and 
returned.</p>

<p>More than one condition <tt>exp-true</tt> pair can occur in an if expression, making it 
look like a 
cond:</p>

<pre>
    (if condition-1 exp-true-1 
        condition-2 exp-true-2 
              ...
        condition-n exp-true-n
        false-expr)
</pre>

<p>The first <tt>exp-true-i</tt> of which the <tt>condition-i</tt> is not <tt>nil</tt> is 
evaluated 
and 
returned or 
the <tt>exp-false</tt> if none of the <tt>condition-i</tt> is <tt>true</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>cond </tt>works like the multiple condition form of if but each part of 
<tt>condition-i</tt> 
<tt>exp-true-i</tt> must be braced in parenthesis:</p>

 <pre>
    (cond 
         (condition-1 exp-true-1 )
         (condition-2 exp-true-2 )
               ...
         (condition-n exp-true-n )
         (true exp-true))
</pre>

<H3>Fuzzy flow</H3>

<p>Using <tt>amb</tt> the program flow can be regulated in a probabilistic fashion:</p>

<pre>
    (amb
        exp-1
        exp-2
        ...
        exp-n)
</pre>

<p>One of the alternative expressions <tt>exp-1</tt> to <tt>exp-n</tt> is evaluated with a probability of <em>p = 1/n</em> and the result is returned from the amb expression.</p>

<h3>Change flow with <tt>catch</tt> and <tt>throw</tt></h3>

<p>Any loop or other expression block can be enclosed in a catch expression. The moment a throw expression is evaluated, the whole catch expression returns the value of the throw expression.</p>
<pre>
    (catch 
       (dotimes (i 10)
           (if (= i 5) (throw "The End"))
            (print i " ")))
    ; will output
     
    0 1 2 3 4
    ; and the return value of the catch expression will be
    &rarr; "The End"
</pre>
<p>Several catch may be nested.</p>

<h3>Leave loops with a break condition</h3>

<p>Loops built using <tt>dotimes</tt>, <tt>dolist</tt> or <tt>for</tt> can specify a 
break condition for leaving the loop early:</p>

<pre>
    (dotimes (x 10 (&gt; (* x x) 9)) 
        (println x))
    &rarr;
    0
    1
    2
    3
    
    (dolist (i '(a b c nil d e) (not i))
        (println i))
    &rarr;
    a
    b
    c
</pre>
<h3>Change flow with <tt>and</tt> or <tt>or</tt></h3>

<p>Similar to programming in the Prolog language, the logical <tt>and</tt> and <tt>or</tt> 
can be used to control program flow depending on the outcome of expressions logically 
connected:</p>

<pre>
    (and
       expr-1
       expr-2
        ...
       expr-n)
</pre>

<p>Expressions are evaluated sequentially until one <tt>expr-i</tt> evaluates to 
<tt>nil</tt> or the empty list <tt>()</tt> or until all <tt>expr-i</tt> are 
exhausted. The last expression evaluated is the return value of the whole <tt>and</tt> 
expression.</p>

<pre>
    (or
       expr-1
       expr-2
        ...
       expr-n)
</pre>

<p>Expressions are evaluated sequentially until one <tt>expr-i</tt> evaluates to 
<u>not</u> <tt>nil</tt> and not <tt>()</tt> or until all <tt>expr-i</tt> are 
exhausted. The last expression evaluated is the return value of the whole or 
expression.</p>

<a name="error"></a>
<h2>8. Error handling</h2>

<p>Several conditions during evaluation of a newLISP expression can cause error exceptions. For a complete list of errors see the Appendix in the newLISP Reference Manual.</p>

<h3>newLISP errors</h3>

<p>newLISP errors are caused by wrong syntax, of function invocation, not supplying the right 
amount of parameters, or supplying parameters with the wrong data type. Or trying to evaluate non existing functions.</p>

<pre>
     ; examples of newLISP errors
     ;
     (foo foo)   &rarr; invalid function : (foo foo)
     (+ "hello") &rarr; value expected in function + : "hello"
</pre>

<h3>User defined errors</h3>

<p>User errors are error exceptions thrown using the function throw-error:</p>

<pre>
    ; user defined error
    ;
    (define (double x)
        (if (= x 99) (throw-error "illegal number"))
        (+ x x))

    (double 8)   &rarr; 16
    (double 10)  &rarr; 20
    (double 99) 
    &rarr;
    user error : illegal number
    called from user defined function double
</pre>

<h3>Error event handlers</h3>
<p>newLISP and user defined errors can be caught using the function error-event to define an event handler.</p>

<pre>
    ; define an error event handler
    ;
    (define (MyHandler)
       (println "An error #" (error-number) " has occurred"))

    (error-event 'MyHandler)

    (foo) &rarr; An error #23 has occurred
</pre>

<h3>Catching errors</h3>
<p>A fine grainier, more specific error exception handling can be achieved using a special syntax of the function catch.</p>

<pre>
    (define (double x)
        (if (= x 99) (throw-error "illegal number"))
        (+ x x))
</pre>

<p>catch with a second parameter can be used to catch both, system and user defined errors:</p>

<pre>
    (catch (double 8) 'result) &rarr; true
    result &rarr; 16
    (catch (double 99) 'result) &rarr; nil
    (print result) 
    &rarr; 
    user error : illegal number
    called from user defined function double

    (catch (double "hi") 'result) &rarr; nil
    (print result)  
    &rarr; 
    value expected in function + : x
    called from user defined function double
</pre>

<p>The catch expression returns true when no error exception occurred and the result of the 
expression is found in the symbol result specified as a second parameter.</p>

<p>If an error exception occurs, it is caught and the catch clause returns nil. In this case 
the symbol result contains the error message.</p>

<h3>Operating system errors</h3>

<p>Some errors originating at operating system level are not caught by newLISP, but can be 
inspected using the function <tt>sys-error</tt>. For example the failure to open a file could 
have different causes:</p>

<pre>
    ;; trying to open a nonexistent file
    (open "blahbla" "r")  →  nil
    (sys-error)           →  (2 "No such file or directory")


    ;; to clear errno specify 0
    (sys-error 0)         →  (0 "Unknown error: 0")
</pre>

<p>Numbers returned may be different on different UNIX platforms. Consult the file <tt>/usr/include/sys/errno.h</tt> on your platform.</p>

<h2>9. Functions as data</h2>
<h3>Manipulate functions after definition</h3>

<pre>
    (define (double x) (+ x x)) 
    &rarr; (lambda (x) (+ x x))
    
    (first double) &rarr; (x)
    (last double)  &rarr; (+ x x)
    
    ;; make a ''fuzzy'' double
    (setf (nth 1 double) '(mul (normal x (div x 10)) 2))
    
    (double 10) &rarr; 20.31445313
    (double 10) &rarr; 19.60351563
</pre>

<p>lambda in newLISP is not an operator or symbol, but rather a special s-expression or list attribute:</p>

<pre>
    (first double) &rarr; (x)   ; not lambda
</pre>

<p>The lambda attribute of an s-expression is right-associative in <tt>append</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    (append (lambda) '((x) (+ x x))) &rarr; (lambda (x) (+ x x))
    ; or shorter
    (append (fn) '((x) (+ x x))) &rarr; (lambda (x) (+ x x))

    (set 'double (append (lambda) '((x) (+ x x)))
    
    (double 10) &rarr; 20
</pre>

<p>and left-associative when using cons:</p>

<pre>
    (cons '(x) (lambda) &rarr; (lambda (x))
</pre>

<p>Lambda expressions in newLISP never loose their first class object property.</p>

<p>The word <tt>lambda</tt> can be abbreviated as <tt>fn</tt>, which is convenient
when mapping or applying functions to make the expression more readable and shorter to type.</p>

<h3>Mapping and applying functions</h3>

<p>Functions or operators can be applied to a list of data at once and all results are returned in a list</p>

<pre>
    (define (double (x) (+ x x))

    (map double '(1 2 3 4 5)) &rarr; (2 4 6 8 10)
</pre>
  
  
<p>Functions can be applied to parameters occurring in a list:</p>

<pre>
    (apply + (sequence 1 10)) &rarr; 55
</pre>

<h3>Function currying: functions making functions</h3>

<p>Here and expression is passed as a parameter:</p>

<pre>
    ; macro expansion using expand
    (define (raise-to power)
        (expand (fn (base) (pow base power)) 'power))

    ; or as an alternative using letex
    (define (raise-to power)
        (letex (p power) (fn (base) (pow base p))))

    (define square (raise-to 2))

    (define cube (raise-to 3))

    (square 5) &rarr; 25
    (cube 5)   &rarr; 125
</pre>

<p>The built-in function <tt>curry</tt> can be used to make a function taking
one argument from a function taking two arguments.</p>

<pre>
    (define add-one (curry add 1))  &rarr; (lambda () (add 1 ($args 0))) 

    (define by-ten (curry mul 10))  &rarr; (lambda () (mul 10 ($args 0)))

    (add-one 5)  &rarr; 6

    (by-ten 1.23)  &rarr; 12.3
</pre>

<p>Note that the <em>curried</em> parameter is always the first parameter
of the original function.</p>

<h2>10. Text processing</h2>
<h3>Regular expressions</h3>

<p>Regular expression in newLISP can be used together with a variety of functions:</p>

<center>
<table border="0" width="90%" cellpadding="5" summary="regex functions">

<tr><td><tt>directory</tt></td><td>Return a list of files, can use a regex patterns for filtering.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>ends-with</tt></td><td>Test if a string ends with a key string or pattern.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>find</tt></td><td>Is used to find the position / offset of a pattern.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>find-all</tt></td><td>Assemble a list of all patterns found.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>parse</tt></td><td>Break a string into token at patterns found between tokens.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>regex</tt></td><td>Find patterns and lists all sub patterns with offset and length found.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>replace</tt></td><td>Replace found patterns with a user defined function, which can take the as input the patterns itself.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>search</tt></td><td>Search for a pattern in a file.</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>starts-with</tt></td><td>Test if a string starts with a key string or pattern.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />

<p>The functions find, regex, replace and search store pattern matching results in the system variable $0 to $15. See the newLISP Users Manual for details.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs show frequently used algorithms for scanning and tokenizing text.</p>

<h3>Scanning text</h3>

<p>replace together with a regular expression pattern can be used to scan text. The pattern in this case describes the tokens scanned for. As each token is found it is pushed on a list. The work is done in the replacement expression part of replace. This example saves all files linked on a web page:</p>

<pre>
    ; tokenize using replace with regular expressions
    
    (set 'page (get-url "http://www.nodep.nl/newlisp/index.html"))
    
    (replace {href="(http://.*lsp)"} page (first (push $1 links)) 0)
    
    (dolist (link links)
       (set 'file (last (parse link "/")))
       (write-file file (get-url link))
       (println "-&gt;" file))
</pre>

<p>Curly braces <tt>{</tt>,<tt>}</tt> are used in the regular expression pattern to avoid escaping the quotes <tt>"</tt> or other character with special meaning in regular expressions.</p>

<p>The following alternative technique is even shorter. The <tt>find-all</tt> function puts all pattern matching strings into a list:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'links (find-all {href="(http://.*lsp)"} page))

    (dolist (link links)
       (set 'file (last (parse link "/")))
       (write-file file (get-url link))
       (println "-&gt;" file))
</pre>


<p>In an additional expressions <tt>find-all</tt> can be directed to do additional
work with subexpressions found:</p>

<pre>
    (find-all {(new)(lisp)} "newLISPisNEWLISP" (append $2 $1) 1)
    
    &rarr; ("LISPnew" "LISPNEW")
</pre>

<p>In the last example <tt>find-all</tt> appends the sub expressions found in reverse
order before returning them in the result list.</p>

<p>Another technique for tokenizing text uses <tt>parse</tt>. While with <tt>replace</tt> 
and <tt>find-all</tt> the regular expression defined the token, when using <tt>parse</tt>
the regex pattern describes the space between the tokens:</p>

<pre>
    ; tokenize using parse
    (set 'str "1 2,3,4 5, 6 7  8")
    (parse str {,\ *|\ +,*} 0) 
    &rarr; ("1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8")
</pre>

<p>Without the curly braces <tt>{</tt>,<tt>}</tt> in the parse pattern the backslashes would 
need to be doubled. Note that there is a space after the backslashes.</p>

<h3>Appending strings</h3>

<p>When appending strings append and join can be used to form a new string:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'lstr (map string (rand 1000 100))) 
    &rarr; ("976" "329" ... "692" "425")

    ;; the wrong slowest way
    (set 'bigStr "")
    (dolist (s lstr) 
        (set 'bigStr (append bigStr s)))

    ;; smarter way - 50 times faster
    ;;
    (apply append lstr)
</pre>

<p>Sometimes strings are not readily available in a list like in the above examples. 
In this case push can be used to push strings on a list while they get produced. 
The list then can be used as an argument for join, making the fastest method for 
putting strings together from existing pieces:</p>

<pre>
    ;; smartest way - 300 times faster
    ;; join an existing list of strings
    ;;
    (join lstr) &rarr; "97632936869242555543 ...."

    ;; join can specify a string between the elements
    ;; to be joined     
    (join lstr "-") &rarr; "976-329-368-692-425-555-43 ...." 
</pre>

<h3>Growing strings in place</h3>

<p>Very often the best method is to grow a string in place. The functions <tt>write-buffer</tt>,
<tt>write-line</tt> and <tt>push</tt> can be used not only to write to file handles or push on
lists but also to write/append to existing strings:</p>

<pre>
    ;; smartest way - 150 times faster
    ;; grow a string in place
    ;;
    ;; using write-buffer
    (set 'bigStr "")
    (dolist (s lstr) (write-buffer bigStr s))
    
    ;; using push
    (set 'bigStr "")
    (dolist (s lstr) (push s bigStr -1))
</pre>

<h3>Rearranging strings</h3>

<p>The function select for selecting elements from lists can also be used to select and re-arrange characters from strings:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'str "eilnpsw")
    (select str '(3 0 -1 2 1 -2 -3)) &rarr; "newlisp"
    
    ; alternative syntax
    (select str 3 0 -1 2 1 -2 -3) &rarr; "newlisp"
</pre>

<p>The second syntax is useful when indexes are specified not as constants but occur as variables.
</p>

<h3>Modifying strings</h3>

<p>newLISP has a variety of functions, which can destructively change a string:</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="0" width="90%" cellpadding="5" summary="modify strings">
<tr><td><tt>replace</tt></td><td>replace all occurrences of a string or string pattern with a string</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>setf</tt></td><td>replace a chracter in a string with one or more characters</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>push pop</tt></td><td>Insert or extract one or more characters at a specific position</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>replace</tt> can also be used to remove all occurrences of string or string pattern
when specifying an empty string <tt>""</tt> as replacement.</p>

<p>When indexing strings with either <tt>nth</tt> or implicit indexing, the string is addressed
at character rather than byte boundaries to work correctly on UTF-8 enabled versions of newLISP.</p>

<h2>11. Dictionaries</h2>

<h3>Dictionaries for hash-like key &rarr; value access</h3>

<p>newLISP has functions to create and manipulate symbols using the functions <tt>sym</tt>
and a special syntax of the function <tt>context</tt>. In older versions of newLISP these 
functions where used to program hash-like creation and access of key-value pairs. 
Now a shorter more convenient method is available using the un-initialized 
<em>default functor</em> of a context (namespace):</p>

<pre>
    (define Myhash:Myhash) ; extabish the namespace and default functor
</pre>

<p>As an alternative to above methods the predefined namespace and default functor 
<tt>Tree</tt> can be used to instantiate a new one:</p>

<pre>
    (new Tree 'Myhash)
</pre>

<p>Both methods produce the same result.</p>

<p>A <em>default functor</em> is the symbol with the same name as the namespace (context) it 
belongs too. If this default functor symbol does not contain anything except <tt>nil</tt>, 
it works like a hash function:</p>

<pre>
    (Myhash "var" 123) ; create and set variable/value pair

    (Myhash "var") &rarr; 123 ; retrieve value

    (Myhash "foo" "hello")

    (Myhash "bar" '(q w e r t y))

    (Myhash "!#@$" '(a b c))
</pre>

<p>Setting a hash symbol to <tt>nil</tt> will effectively erase it:</p>

<pre>
    (Myhash "bar" nil)
</pre>

<p>The key can be any string, symbol clashes with built-in newLISP symbols are avoided by 
newLISP prepending and underscore character to all key strings internally. The value can 
be any string, number or any other other newLISP s-expression.</p>

<p>The <tt>Myhash</tt> namespace can be transformed in an association list:</p>

<pre>
    (Myhash) &rarr; (("!#@$" (a b c)) ("foo" "hello") ("var" 123))
</pre>

<p>Or the raw contents of <tt>Myhash</tt> can be shown using the <tt>symbols</tt>
function:</p>

<pre>
    (symbols Myhash) &rarr; (Myhash:Myhash Myhash:_!#@$ Myhash:_foo Myhash:_var)
</pre>

<p>Dictionaries can be built converting an existing association list:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'aList '(("one" 1) ("two" 2) ("three")))

    (Myhash aList)

    (Myhash) &rarr; (("!#@$" (a b c)) ("foo" "hello") ("one" 1) ("three" nil) ("two" 2) ("var" 123))
</pre>

<h3>Saving and loading dictionaries</h3>

<p>The dictionary can be easily saved to a file by serializing the namespace <tt>Myhash</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    (save "Myhash.lsp" 'Myhash)
</pre>

<p>The whole namespace is saved to the file <tt>Myhash.lsp</tt> and can be reloaded into newLISP
at a later time:</p>

<pre>
    (load "Myhash")
</pre>

<p>Note that hashes create contexts similar to the <tt>bayes-train</tt> function. All
string keys are prepended with an underscore and then transfomed into a symbol. This
means that namespaces created using <tt>bayes-train</tt> can be used like hashes to
retrieve words and their statistics. See the <tt>bayes-train</tt> function in the manual for
more detail.</p>

<h2>12. TCP/IP client server communications</h2>

<h3>Client - server TCP/IP - open connection</h3>

<p>In this pattern the server keeps the connection open until the client closes the connection, 
then the server loops into a new listen:</p>

<pre>
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; the server
    ; maximum bytes to receive

    (if (not (set 'listen (net-listen 123)))

    (while (not (net-error))

        (while (not (net-error))
             (net-receive connection message-from-client max-bytes)
             .... process message from client ...
             .... configure message to client ...
             (net-send connection message-to-client)) )
             
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; the client
    ; client connect
    (if (not (set 'connection (net-connect "host.com" 123)))
        (println (net-error)))
    ; maximum bytes to receive
    (constant 'max-bytes 1024)
    ; message send-receive loop

<h3>Client - server TCP/IP - closed transaction</h3>

<p>In this pattern the server closes the connection after each transaction exchange 
of messages.</p>

<pre>
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; server
    (while (not (net-error))
        (set 'connection (net-accept listen)) ;; blocking here
        (net-receive connection message-from-client max-bytes)
             .... process message from client ...
             .... configure message to client ...
        (net-send connection message-to-client)
        (close connection))
        
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; client 
    (if (not (set 'connection (net-connect "host.com" 123)))
        (println (net-error)))
    ; maximum bytes to receive
    (constant 'max-bytes 1024)
      .... configure message to server ...
    (net-send connection message-to-server)
    (net-receive connection message-from-server max-bytes)
      .... process message-from-server ...
</pre>

<p>There are many different ways to set up a client/server connection, see also the examples 
in the newLISP manual.</p>

<a name="udp"></a>
<h2>13. UDP communications</h2>

<p>They are fast and need less setup than TCP/IP and offer <em>multi casting</em>. UDP 
is also less reliable because the protocol does less checking, i.e. of correct packet 
sequence or if all packets are received. This is normally no problem when not working on 
the Internet but in a well controlled local network or when doing machine control. A 
simple more specific protocol could be made part of the message.</p>

<h3>Open communications with UDP</h3>

<p>In this example the server keeps the connection open. UDP communications with net-listen, 
net-receive-from and net-send-to can block on receiving.</p>

<p>Note that both, the client and server use <tt>net-listen</tt> with the <tt>"udp"</tt>
option. In this case <tt>net-listen</tt> is only used for binding the socket to the
address, it is not used for listening for an connection. The server could receive messages
from several clients. The <tt>net-send-to</tt> function extracts the target address from 
the message received.</p>

<pre>
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; server
    (set 'socket (net-listen 10001 "" "udp"))
    (if socket (println "server listening on port " 10001)
       (println (net-error)))
    (while (not (net-error))
       (set 'msg (net-receive-from socket 255))
       (println "-&gt;" msg)
       (net-send-to (nth 1 msg) (nth 2 msg) 
                    (upper-case (first msg)) socket))

    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; client
    (set 'socket (net-listen 10002 "" "udp"))
    (if (not socket) (println (net-error)))
    (while (not (net-error))
       (print "-&gt;")
       (net-send-to "127.0.0.1" 10001 (read-line) socket)
       (net-receive socket buff 255)
       (println "&rarr;" buff))
</pre>

<h3>Closed transaction oriented UDP</h3>

<p>This form is some times used for controlling hardware or equipment. No setup is 
required, just one function for sending, another one for receiving:</p>

<pre>
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; server
    ;; wait for data gram with maximum 20 bytes 
    (net-receive-udp 1001 20) 
    ;; or
    (net-receive-udp 1001 20 5000000)  ;; wait for max 5 seconds

    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; client
    (net-send-udp "host.com" 1001 "Hello")
</pre>

<p>Win32 and Linux show different behavior when sending less or more bytes then specified 
on the receiving end.</p>

<h3>UDP multi-cast communications</h3>

<p>In this scheme the server subscribes to one of a range of multi cast addresses using the 
net-listen function.</p>

<pre>
    ;; example server
    (net-listen 4096 "226.0.0.1" "multi") &rarr; 5
    (net-receive-from 5 20)             

    ;; example client I
    (net-connect "226.0.0.1" 4096 "multi") &rarr; 3
    (net-send 3 "hello")

    ;; example client II
    (net-connect "" 4096 "multi") &rarr; 3
    (net-send-to "226.0.0.1" 4096 "hello" 3)
</pre>

<p>The connection in the example is blocking on <tt>net-receive</tt> but could be de-blocked 
using <tt>net-select</tt> or <tt>net-peek</tt></p>

<center>&sect;</center>

<a name="nonblock"></a>
<h2>14. Non-blocking communications</h2>

<h3>Using net-select</h3>

<p>In all previous patterns the client blocks when in receive. The net-select call can be 
used to unblock communications:</p>

<pre>
    ;; optionally poll for arriving data with 100ms timeout
    (while (not (net-select connection "r" 100000)) 
        (do-something-while-waiting ...))
    
    (net-receive...)
</pre>

<p><tt>connection</tt> can be a single number for a connection socket or a list of numbers 
to wait on various sockets.</p>

<h3>Using net-peek</h3>

<pre>
    (while ( = (net-peek aSock) 0) 
       (do-something-while-waiting ...))
    (net-receive...)
</pre>

<center>&sect;</center>

<a name="controlling"></a>
<h2>15. Controlling other applications</h2>


<h3>Controlling an application with <tt>exec</tt></h3>

<p>This method is only suited for short exchanges, executing one command and receiving 
the output.</p>

<pre>
    (exec "ls *.c") &rarr; ("." ".." "util.c" "example.ls")
</pre>

<p>The <tt>exec</tt> function opens a process pipe for the Unix command-line utility 
<tt>ls</tt> and collects each line of STDOUT into a list of strings.</p>

<p>Most following examples use <tt>process</tt> to launch an application. This function returns 
immediately after launching the other application and does not block.</p>

<p>In all of the following patterns the server is not independent but controlled by the client, 
which launches the server and then communicates via a line oriented protocol:</p>

<pre>
    &rarr; launch server
    &larr; talk to server
    &larr; wait for response from server
    &rarr; talk to server
    &larr; wait for response from server
        .....
</pre>
<p>Sometimes a sleep time is necessary on the client side to wait for the server to be ready loading. 
Except for the first example, most of these are condensed snippets from GTK-Server from 
<a href="http://www.gtk-server.org">www.gtk-server.org</a>. The basic program logic will be
the same for any other application.</p>

<h3>Communications via STD I/O pipes</h3>

<p>The <tt>process</tt> fucntion allows specifying 2 pipes for communications with the launched 
application.</p>

<pre>
    ; setup communications
    (map set '(myin tcout) (pipe))
    (map set '(tcin myout) (pipe))
    (process "/usr/bin/wish" tcin tcout)

    ; make GUI
    (write-buffer myout
    [text]
    wm geometry . 250x90
    wm title . "Tcl/Tk and newLISP"

    bind . &lt;Destroy&gt; {puts {(exit)}}
    [/text])

    ; run event loop
    (while (read-line myin)
        (eval-string (current-line))
    )
</pre>

<p>This is the preferred way to set up longer lasting, bidirectional communications with
Unix command line utilities and languages. For one-command exchanges the <tt>exec</tt> 
function does the job shorter.</p>

<p>For a more elaborate Tcl/Tk example see the application <tt>examples/tcltk.lsp</tt> in
the source distribution.</p> 

<h3>communications via TCP/IP</h3>

<pre>
    ; Define communication function
    (define (gtk str , tmp)
        (net-send connection str)
        (net-receive connection tmp 64)
        tmp)
    
    ; Start the gtk-server
    (process "gtk-server tcp localhost:50000")
    (sleep 1000)

    ; Connect to the GTK-server
    (set 'connection (net-connect "localhost" 50000))
    (set 'result (gtk "gtk_init NULL NULL"))
    (set 'result (gtk "gtk_window_new 0"))
              .....
</pre>


<h3>Communicate via named FIFO</h3>

<p>Make a FIFO first (looks like a special file node):</p>

<pre>
     (exec "mkfifo myfifo")

    ;; or alternatively
    
    (import "/lib/libc.so.6" "mkfifo")
    (mkfifo "/tmp/myfifo" 0777)
    
    ; Define communication function
    (define (gtk str)
        (set 'handle (open "myfifo" "write"))
        (write-buffer handle str)
        (close handle)
        (set 'handle (open "myfifo" "read"))
        (read-buffer handle tmp 20)
        (close handle)
        tmp)
</pre>

<h3>Communicate via UDP</h3>

<p>Note that the listen function with "udp" option just binds the sockets to a 
address/hardware but not actually listens as in TCP/IP.</p>

<pre>
    ; Define communication function
    (define (gtk str , tmp)
       (net-send-to "localhost" 50000 str socket)
       (net-receive socket 'tmp net-buffer)
       tmp)
       
    ; Start the gtk-server
    (define (start)
       (process "gtk-server udp localhost:50000")
       (sleep 500)
       (set 'socket (net-listen 50001 "localhost" "udp")) )
    
    (set 'result (gtk "gtk_init NULL NULL"))
    
    (set 'result (gtk "gtk_window_new 0"))
             .....
</pre>

<a name="launching"></a>
<h2>16. Launching applications blocking</h2>

<h3>Shell execution</h3>

<p>This is frequently used from newLISP's interactive command line to execute processes 
in a blocking fashion, which need a shell to run:</p>

<pre>
    (! "ls -ltr")
</pre>

<p>There is an interesting variant of this form working not inside a newLISP expression, 
but only on the command line:</p>

<pre>
    !ls -ltr
</pre>

<p>The <tt>!</tt> should be the first character on the command line. This form works like 
a shell escape in the VI editor. It is useful for invoking an editor or doing quick 
shell work without completely leaving the newLISP console.</p>

<h3>Execution capturing std-out in a list</h3>

<pre>
    (exec "ls /") &rarr; ("bin" "etc" "home" "lib")
</pre>


<h3>Execution feeding std-in</h3>

<pre>
    (exec "script.cgi" cgi-input)
</pre>

<p>In this example <tt>cgi-input</tt> could contain a string feeding a query input, normally 
coming from a web server. Note that output in this case is written directly to the screen, 
and cannot be returned to newLISP. Use process and pipe for two way std i/o communications 
with other applications.</p>

<center>&sect;</center>

<a name="processes"></a>
<h2>17. Processes, semaphores and shared memory</h2>

<p>Shared memory, semaphores and processes work frequently together. Semaphores can synchronize tasks 
in different process threads and shared memory can be used to communicate between them.</p>

<p>The following is a more complex example showing the working of all three mechanisms at 
the same time.</p>

<p>The producer loops through all n values from i = 0 to n - 1 and puts each value into shared 
memory where it is picked up by the consumer thread. Semaphores are used to signal that a data 
value is ready for reading.</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp
    # prodcons.lsp -  Producer/consumer
    #
    # usage of 'fork', 'wait-pid', 'semaphore' and 'share'
    
    (when (= ostype "Win32")
        (println "this will not run on Win32")
        (exit))
 
    (constant 'wait -1 'sig 1 'release 0)
    
    (define (consumer n)
        (set 'i 0)
        (while (< i n)
           (semaphore cons-sem wait)
           (println (set 'i (share data)) " <-")
           (semaphore prod-sem sig))  
           (exit))
                    
    (define (producer n)
        (for (i 1 n)
           (semaphore prod-sem wait)
           (println "-> " (share data i))
           (semaphore cons-sem sig))   
           (exit))
           
    (define (run n)
        (set 'data (share)) 
        (share data 0)
        (set 'prod-sem (semaphore)) ; get semaphores
        (set 'cons-sem (semaphore))
        (set 'prod-pid (fork (producer n))) ; start processes 
        (set 'cons-pid (fork (consumer n)))
        (semaphore prod-sem sig) ; get producer started
        (wait-pid prod-pid) ; wait for processes to finish
        (wait-pid cons-pid) ; 
        (semaphore cons-sem release) ; release semaphores
        (semaphore prod-sem release))
        
    (run 10)
    
    (exit)

<a name="multiprocessing"></a>
<h2>18. Multiprocessing and the Cilk API</h2>

<p>On multiprocessor CPUs the operating system will distribute processes and child processes 
created on to different processor cores in an optimized fashion. 
newLISP offers a simple API which does all the work of launching processes and 
does the synchronized collection of evaluation results.
The <a href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/cilk/">Cilk</a> API consists of only 3 function 
calls implemented in newLISP as <tt>spawn</tt>, <tt>sync</tt> and <tt>abort</tt></p>

<p>Since v.10.1 newLISP's <tt>message</tt> function enables communications between parent and
child processes. For more details about this see the next chapter
<a href="#messaging">Message exchange between processes</a>.</p> 

<h3>Starting concurrent processes</h3>

<pre>
    ; calculate primes in a range
    (define (primes from to)
      (local (plist)
          (for (i from to)
              (if (= 1 (length (factor i)))
                  (push i plist -1)))
          plist))

    ; start child processes
    (set 'start (time-of-day))

    (spawn 'p1 (primes 1 1000000))
    (spawn 'p2 (primes 1000001 2000000))
    (spawn 'p3 (primes 2000001 3000000))
    (spawn 'p4 (primes 3000001 4000000))

    ; wait for a maximum of 60 seconds for all tasks to finish
    (sync 60000) ; returns true if all finished in time
    ; p1, p2, p3 and p4 now each contain a lists of primes
</pre>

<p>The example shows, how a range of prime number generation is split up for parallel processing 
in three sub-ranges. All <tt>spawn</tt> calls will return immediately, but <tt>sync</tt> will block
until all three child processes have finished and the result lists are available in the four
variables <tt>p1</tt> to <tt>p4</tt>.</p>

<h3>Watching progress</h3>

<p>When the timeout value specified is too short for all prcesses to
finish, <tt>sync</tt> will return <tt>nil</tt>. This can be use to watch progess:</p>

<pre>
    ; print a dot after each 2 seconds of waiting
    (until (sync 2000) (println "."))
</pre>

<p>When <tt>sync</tt> is called without parameters, it returns a list of still
active process ids:</p>

<pre>
    ; show a list of pending process ids after 
    ;each three-tenths of a second
    (until (sync 300) (println (sync)))
</pre>

<h3>Invoking spawn recursively</h3>

<pre>
    (define (fibo n)  
      (local (f1 f2)
        (if(&lt; n 2) 1
           (begin
              (spawn 'f1 (fibo (- n 1)))
              (spawn 'f2 (fibo (- n 2)))
              (sync 10000)
              (+ f1 f2)))))

    (fibo 7)  &rarr; 21
</pre>

<h3>Event driven notification</h3>

<p>When processes launched with <tt>spawn</tt> finish, an <em>inlet</em> function
specified in the <tt>sync</tt> statement can be called.</p>

<pre>
    (define (report pid)
        (println "process: " pid " has returned"))

    ; call the report function, when a child returns
    (sync 10000 report)
</pre>


<center>&sect;</center>

<a name="messaging"></a>
<h2>19. Message exchange between processes</h2>

<p>Parent and child processes started with <tt>spawn</tt> can exchange messages.
Messages flow either from  the parent to child processes or from child processes
to the parent. By means of evaluating messsages in the parent process, the parent
process can be used as a proxy routing message between peer child processes.</p>

<p>The message calls itself are non-blocking returning <tt>nil</tt> on
failure. They can be made blocking using loops:</p>

<pre>
    ; blocking sender
    (until (send pid msg)) ; returns true after delivery

    ; blocking receiver
    (until (receive pid msg))     ; returns true after pickup
</pre>

<h3>Collecting synchronous messages</h3>

<p>The parent process loops through a list of child process ids and looks
for message notifications. In the following example message calls are
blocking and synchronous.</p> 

<pre>
    ; child process transmits random numbers

    (define (child-process)
        (set 'ppid (sys-info -4)) ; get parent pid
        (while true
            (until (send ppid (rand 100))))
    )

    ; parent starts 5  child processes, listens and displays

    (dotimes (i 5) (spawn 'result (child-process)))

    (for (i 1 3)
        (dolist (cpid (sync)) ; iterate thru child pids
            (until (receive cpid msg))
           (print "pid:" cpid "-&gt;" (format "%-2d  " msg)))
        (println)
    )

    (abort) ; cancel child-processes

    (exit)
</pre>

<p>generates this output:</p>

<pre>  pid:53181-&gt;47  pid:53180-&gt;61  pid:53179-&gt;75  pid:53178-&gt;39  pid:53177-&gt;3   
  pid:53181-&gt;59  pid:53180-&gt;12  pid:53179-&gt;20  pid:53178-&gt;77  pid:53177-&gt;47  
  pid:53181-&gt;6   pid:53180-&gt;56  pid:53179-&gt;96  pid:53178-&gt;78  pid:53177-&gt;18
</pre>

<h3>Collecting asynchronous messages</h3>

<p>Neither the sending child process nor the receiving parent process
block. Each sends and receives messages as fast as possible.</p>

<pre>
   ; child process transmits random numbers non-blocking
   ; not all calls succeed
    (set 'start (time-of-day))

    (define (child-process)
        (set 'ppid (sys-info -4)) ; get parent pid
        (while true
            (until (send ppid (rand 100))))
    )

    ; parent starts 5  child processes, listens and displays
    (dotimes (i 5) (spawn 'result (child-process)))

    (set 'N 1000)

    (until finished
        (if (= (inc counter) N) (set 'finished true))
        (dolist (cpid (sync)) ; iterate thru child pids
            (receive cpid msg)
            (if msg (print "pid:" cpid "-&gt;" (format "%-2d  \r" msg))))
    )

    (abort) ; cancel child-processes
    (sleep 300)

    (exit)
</pre>

<h3>Implementing message timeouts</h3>

<p>A messaging statement can be made to block for a certain time:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
(define (receive-timeout pid msec)
	(let ( (start (time-of-day)) (msg nil))
		(until (receive pid msg)
			(if (&gt; (- (time-of-day) start) 1000) (throw-error "timeout")))
		msg)
)
; use it

(receive-timeout pid 1000)  ; returns the message or throws error
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example blocking will occcur for 1000 ms. Many methods exist
to implement timeout behavior.</p>

<h3>Evaluating messages</h3>

<p>Messages sent can contain expressions which can be evaluated in the recipients
environment. This way variables can be set, messages routed to other processes.
The following example implements a message router:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
; sender process of the message
(set 'pidA (spawn 'result
    (begin 
        (dotimes (i 3)
            (set 'ppid (sys-info -4))
            (set 'pid (sys-info -3))
            (set 'msg '(until (send pidB (string "greetings from " pidA))))
            (until (send ppid msg))) ; send expression in msg
        ; make parent exit until loop
        (until (send ppid '(set 'finished true)))
)))

; final message recipient
(set 'pidB (spawn 'result
    (begin
        (set 'ppid (sys-info -4))
        (set 'pid (sys-info -3))
        (while true
            (until (receive ppid msg))
            (println pid " received " msg))
)))

; receive and evaluate messages from pidA
(until finished (if (receive pidA msg) (eval msg)))

(abort) (sleep 300)
(exit)
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Acting as a proxy</h3>

<p>The expression:</p>

<pre>    (until (send pidB (string "greetings from " pidA)))
</pre>

<p>does get send from pidA to the parent, where it is evaluated,
causing a message to be sent to pidB. The parent process acts
as a proxy agent for process with pidA.</p>   

<pre>    (until (send ppid '(set 'finished true)))</pre>

<p>The expression <tt>(set 'finished true)</tt> is sent to the parent 
where it gets evaluated and causes the parent's <tt>until</tt> loop
to finish.</p>

<a name="databases"></a>
<h2>20. Databases and lookup tables</h2>

<p>newLISP uses symbol trees to implement hashes. Symbols in name spaces can also be 
serialized to a file, as will be shown in the chapter about symbol creation and lookup.</p>

<h3>Association lists</h3>

<p>The association list is a classic LISP data structure for storing information for associative 
retrieval:</p>

<pre>
    ;; creating association lists
    ;; pushing at the end with -1 is optimized and 
    ;; as fast as pushing in front
    
    (push '("John Doe" "123-5555" 1200.00) Persons -1)
    (push '("Jane Doe" "456-7777" 2000.00) Persons -1)
        .....
    
    Persons &rarr;  (
        ("John Doe" "123-5555" 1200.00) 
        ("Jane Doe" "456-7777" 2000.00) ...)
        
    ;; access/lookup data records
    (assoc "John Doe" Persons) 
    
    &rarr; ("John Doe" "123-5555" 1200.00 male)
    
    (assoc "Jane Doe" Persons) 
     
    &rarr; ("Jane Doe" "456-7777" 2000.00 female)
</pre>

<p>newLISP has a lookup function similar to what is used in spreadsheet software. This function 
which works like a combination of <tt>assoc</tt> and <tt>nth</tt> can find the association and 
pick a specific member of the data record at the same time:</p>

<pre>
    (lookup "John Doe" Persons 0)   &rarr; "123-555"
    (lookup "John Doe" Persons -1)  &rarr; make
    (lookup "Jane Doe" Persons 1)   &rarr; 2000.00
    (lookup "Jane Doe" Persons -2)  &rarr; 2000.00
    
    ;; update data records
    (setf (assoc "John Doe" Persons) 
                   '("John Doe" "123-5555" 900.00 male))
    
    ;; replace as a function of existing/replaced data
    (setf (assoc "John Doe" Persons) (update-person $it))
    
    ;; delete data records
    (replace (assoc "John Doe" Persons) Persons)
</pre>

<h3>Nested associations</h3>

<p>If the data part of an association is itself an association llist, we have a 
nested association:</p>

<pre>
    (set 'persons '(
        ("Anne" (address (country "USA") (city "New York")))
        ("Jean" (address (country "France") (city "Paris")))
    ))
</pre>

<p>A different syntax of the <tt>assoc</tt> function can be used to specify multiple 
keys:</p>

<pre>
    ; one key
    (assoc "Anne" persons) &rarr; ("Anne" (address (country "USA") (city "New York")))

    ; two keys
    (assoc '("Anne" 'address) persons) &rarr; (address (country "USA") (city "New York"))

    ; three keys
    (assoc '("Anne" address city) persons) &rarr; (city "New York")
    
    ; three keys in a vector
    (set 'anne-city '("Anne" address city))
    (assoc anne-city persons) &rarr; (city "New York")
</pre>

<p>When all keys are symbols, as is in <tt>address</tt>, <tt>country</tt>
and <tt>city</tt>, simple and nested associations in newLISP have the same format as newLISP
<tt>FOOP</tt> (Functional Object Oriented Programming) objects. See the users manual chapter
"17. Object Oriented Programming in newLISP" for details.</p>

<h3>Updating nested associations</h3>

<p>The functions <tt>assoc</tt> and <tt>setf</tt> can be used to update simple
or nested associations:</p>

<pre>
    (setf '("Anne" address city) persons '(city "Boston")) &rarr; (city "New York")
</pre>

<p><tt>setf</tt> always returns the newly set element.</p>

<h3>In-memory database with keyed access</h3>

<p>Hashes and FOOP objects can be combined to form an in-memory database
with keyed access.</p>

In the following example data records are stored in a hash namespace
and access with the name of the person as a key.

<p><tt>setf</tt>  and <tt>lookup</tt> are used to update nested FOOP objects:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
(new Tree 'Person)
(new Class 'Address)
(new Class 'City)
(new Class 'Telefone)


(Person "John Doe" (Address (City "Small Town") (Telefone 5551234)))

(lookup 'Telefone (Person "John Doe"))
(setf (lookup 'Telefone (Person "John Doe")) 1234567)
(setf (lookup 'City (Person "John Doe")) (lower-case $it))

(Person "John Doe") &rarr; (Address (City "small town") (Telefone 1234567))
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="distributed"></a>
<h2>21. Distributed computing and server mode</h2>

<p>Many of todays applications are distributed on to several computers on the 
network or distibuted on to several processes on one CPU. Often both methods
of distributing an application are used at the same time.</p>

<p>newLISP has facilities to evaluate many expressions in parallel 
on different network nodes or processes running newLISP. The <tt>net-eval</tt> function
does all the work necessary to communicate to other nodes, distribute expressions
for evaluation and collect results in either a blocking or event driven fashion.</p>

<p>The functions <tt>read-file</tt>, <tt>write-file</tt>, <tt>append-file</tt>
and <tt>delete-file</tt> can also be used to access with files on remote nodes when using
URLs in file specifications. In a similar way the functions <tt>load</tt> and
<tt>save</tt> can be used to load and save code from and to remote nodes.</p>

<p>newLISP uses existing HTTP protocols and newLISP command line behavior to implement
this functionality. This means that programs can be debugged and tested using standard
UNIX applications like terminal, telnet or a web browser. This also enables 
easy integration of other tools and programs into distributed applications built with newLISP. 
For example the UNIX utility <i>netcat</i> (<i>nc</i>) could be used to evaluate expressions
remotely or a web browser could be used to retrieve webpages from nodes running a newLISP 
server.</p>


<h3>Setting up a newLISP server node</h3>

<p>A newLISP server node is essentially a newLISP process listening to a network
port and behaving like a newLISP command-line console and HTTP server for HTTP 
<tt>GET</tt>, <tt>PUT</tt>, <tt>POST</tt> and <tt>DELETE</tt> requests. Since version 9.1 newLISP
server mode also answers <tt>CGI</tt> queries received by either <tt>GET</tt>
or <tt>POST</tt> request.</p>

<p>Two methods are used to start a newLISP server node. One results in a state full
server, maintaining state in between communications with different clients, the other
method a server with no state, reloading for every new client connection.</p>

<b>Start a newLISP state-full server</b>

<pre>
    newlisp -c -d 4711 &amp;

    newlisp myprog.lsp -c -d 4711 &amp;

    newlisp myprog.lsp -c -w /home/node25 -d 4711 &amp;
</pre>

<p>newLISP is now listening on port 4711, the &amp; (ampersand) sign tells
newLISP to run in the background (UNIX only). The <tt>-c</tt> switch suppresses command line
prompts. newLISP now behaves like a newLISP console without prompts listening on port
4711 for command line like input. Any other available port could have been chosen. Note that 
on UNIX ports below 1024 need administrator access rights.</p>

<p>The second example also pre-loads code. The third example also specifies a working
directory using the <tt>-w</tt> option. If no working directory is specified using <tt>-w</tt>
the startup directory is assumed to be the working directory.</p>

<b>Start a newLISP <tt>inetd</tt> stateless server</b>

<p>On UNIX the <i>inetd</i> or <i>xindetd</i> facility can be used to start a stateless
server. In this case the TCP/IP net connections are managed by a special UNIX utility
with the ability to handle multiple requests at the same time. For each connection
made by a client the <i>inetd</i> or <i>xinetd</i> utility will start a fresh newLISP
process. After the connection is closed the newLISP process will shut down.</p>

<p>When nodes are not required to keep state, this is the preferred method for a 
newLISP server node, for handling multiple connections at the same time.</p>

<p>The <i>inetd</i> or <i>xinetd</i> process needs to be configured using configuration
files found in the <tt>/etc</tt> directory of most UNIX installations.</p>

<p>For both the <i>inetd</i> and <i>xinetd</i> configurations add the following line
to the <tt>/etc/services</tt> file:</p>

<pre>
    net-eval        4711/tcp     # newLISP net-eval requests
</pre>

<p>Note that any other port than <tt>4711</tt> could be supplied.</p>

<p>When configuring <i>inetd</i> add also the following lines to the <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>
file:</p>

<pre>
    net-eval  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/bin/newlisp -c
                                             
    # as an alternative, a program can also be preloaded
                                             
    net-eval  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/bin/newlisp myprog.lsp -c

    # a working directory can also be specified

    net-eval  stream  tcp  nowait  newlisp  /usr/bin/newlisp -c -w /usr/home/newlisp
</pre>

<p>The last line also specified a working directory and a user <tt>newlisp</tt>
instead of the <tt>root</tt> user. This is a more secure mode limiting newLISP
server node access to a specific user account with restricted permissions.</p>

<p>On some UNIX system a modern flavor of <i>inetd</i>: the 
<i>xinetd</i> facility can be used. Add the following configuration to a file 
<tt>/etc/xinet.d/net-eval</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    service net-eval
    {
        socket_type = stream
        wait = no
        user = root
        server = /usr/bin/newlisp
        port = 4711
        server_args = -c -w /home/node
    }
</pre>

<p>Note that a variety of parameter combinations are possible to restrict access from
different places or limit access to certain users. Consult the man-pages for <i>inetd</i> 
and <i>xinetd</i> for details.</p>

<p>After configuring <i>inetd</i> or <i>xinetd</i> either process must be restarted
to re-read the configuration files. This can be accomplished by sending the 
UNIX <tt>HUP</tt> signal to either the <i>inetd</i> or <i>xinetd</i> process using
the UNIX <i>kill</i> or UNIX <i>nohup</i> utility.</p>

<p>On Mac OS X the <tt>launchd</tt> facility can be used in a similar fashion.
The newLISP source distribution contains the file <tt>org.newlisp.newlisp.plist</tt>
in the <tt>util/</tt> directory. This file can be used to launch newlisp server during 
OS boot time as a persisten server.</p>


<b>Testing the server using <i>telnet</i></b>

<p>A newLISP server node can be tested using the UNIX <i>telnet</i> utility:</p>

<pre>
    telnet localhost 4711

    ; or when running on a different computer i.e. ip 192.168.1.100

    telnet 192.168.1.100 4711
</pre>

<p>Multi-line expressions can be entered by enclosing them in <tt>[cmd]</tt>, <tt>[/cmd]</tt>
tags, each tag on a separate line. Both, the opening and closing tags should be on separate lines.</p>


<b>Testing the server using <i>netcat</i> (named <i>nc</i> on most UNIX)</b>

<pre>
    echo '(symbols) (exit)' | nc localhost 4711
</pre>

<p>Or talking to a remote node:</p>

<pre>
    echo '(symbols) (exit)' | nc 192.168.1.100 4711
</pre>

<p>In both examples <i>netcat</i> will echo back the result of evaluating the
<tt>(symbols)</tt> expression.</p>

<p>Multi-line expressions can be entered by enclosing them in <tt>[cmd]</tt>, <tt>[/cmd]</tt>
tags, each tag on a separate line.</p>

<b>Testing the server from a newLISP command line</b>

<p>The <tt>net-eval</tt> function as a syntax form for connecting to only one remote
server node. This mode is practical for quick testing from the newLISP command line:</p>

<pre>
    (net-eval "localhost" 4711 "(+ 3 4)" 1000) &rarr; 7

    ; to a remote node

    (net-eval "192.168.1.100" 4711 {(upper-case "newlisp")} 1000) &rarr; "NEWLISP"
</pre>

<p>In the second example curly braces <tt>{,}</tt> are used to limit the program string
for evaluation. This way quotes can be used to limit a string inside the expression.</p>

<p>No <tt>[cmd]</tt>, <tt>[/cmd]</tt> tags are required when sending multi-line expressions.
<tt>net-eval</tt> supplies these tags automatically.</p>

<b>Testing the server HTTP mode using a web browser</b>

<p>A newLISP server also understands simple HTTP <tt>GET</tt> and <tt>PUT</tt>
requests. Enter the full path of a file 
in the address-bar of the browser:</p>

<pre>
    http://localhost:4711//usr/share/newlisp/doc/newlisp_manual.html
</pre>

<p>The manual file is almost 800 Kbyte in size and will take a few seconds to load into
the browser. Specify the port-number with a colon separated from the host-name or host IP.
Note the double slash <tt>//</tt> necessary to specify a file address relative to the root
directory.</p>

<h3>Evaluating multiple expressions remotely</h3>

<p>When testing the correct installation of newLISP server nodes, we were already
sending expressions to remote node for evaluation. Many times remote evaluation is
used to split up a lengthy task into shorter subtasks for remote evaluation on different
nodes.</p>

<p>The first example is trivial, because it only evaluates several very simple
expressions remotely, but it shows the principles involved in a way easy to
understand:</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp

    (set 'result (net-eval '(    
        ("192.168.1.100" 4711 {(+ 3 4)})
        ("192.168.1.101" 4711 {(+ 5 6)})
        ("192.168.1.102" 4711 {(+ 7 8)})
        ("192.168.1.103" 4711 {(+ 9 10)})
        ("192.168.1.104" 4711 {(+ 11 12)})  
    ) 1000))


    (println "result: " result)

    (exit)
</pre>

<p>Running this program will produce the following output:</p>

<pre>
    result: (7 11 15 19 23)
</pre>

<p>When running UNIX and using an <i>inetd</i> or <i>xinetd</i> configured newLISP
server, the servers and programs can be run on just one CPU replacing all IP numbers with 
<tt>"localhost"</tt> or the same local IP number. The <i>indetd</i> or <i>xinetd</i>
daemon will then start 5 independent newLISP processes. On Win32 5 state-full
newLISP servers could be started on different port numbers to accomplish the same.</p>

<p>Instead of collecting all results at one on the return of <tt>net-eval</tt>, a
call back function can be used to receive and process results as they become available:</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp

    (define (idle-loop p)
        (if p (println p)))

    (set 'result (net-eval '(    
        ("192.168.1.100" 4711 {(+ 3 4)})
        ("192.168.1.101" 4711 {(+ 5 6)})
        ("192.168.1.102" 4711 {(+ 7 8)})
        ("192.168.1.103" 4711 {(+ 9 10)})
        ("192.168.1.104" 4711 {(+ 11 12)})  
    ) 1000 idle-loop))

    (exit)
</pre>

<p>While <tt>net-eval</tt> is waiting for results it calls the function <tt>idle-loop</tt>
repeatedly with parameter <tt>p</tt>. The parameter <tt>p</tt> is <tt>nil</tt> when no result
was received during the last 100 micro seconds or <tt>p</tt> contains a list sent back 
from the remote node. The list contains the remote address and port and the evaluation result. 
The example shown would generate the following output:</p>

<pre>
    ("192.168.1.100" 4711 7)
    ("192.168.1.101" 4711 11)
    ("192.168.1.102" 4711 15)
    ("192.168.1.103" 4711 19)
    ("192.168.1.104" 4711 23)
</pre>

<p>For testing on just one CPU replace addresses with <tt>"localhost"</tt>
the UNIX <i>inetd</i> or <i>xinetd</i> daemon will start a separate process
for each connection made and all listening on port <tt>4711</tt>. When using
a state-full server on the same Win32 CPU specify a different port number for 
each server</p>

<b>Setting up the <tt>net-eval</tt> parameter structure</b>

<p>In a networked environment where an application gets moved around, or server
nodes with changing IP numbers are used, it is necessary to set up the node
parameters in the <tt>net-eval</tt> parameter list as variables. The following 
more complex example shows how this can be done. The example also shows how
a bigger piece of program text can be transferred to a remote node for evaluation
and how this program piece can be customized for each node differently:</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp

    ; node parameters
    (set 'nodes '(
        ("192.168.1.100" 4711)
        ("192.168.1.101" 4711)
        ("192.168.1.102" 4711)
        ("192.168.1.103" 4711)
        ("192.168.1.104" 4711)
    ))

    ; program template for nodes
    (set 'program [text]
    (begin
        (map set '(from to node) '(%d %d %d))
        (for (x from to)
            (if (= 1 (length (factor x)))
            (push x primes -1)))
        primes)
    [/text])

    ; call back routine for net-eval
    (define (idle-loop p)
        (if p
            (begin
                (println (p 0) ":" (p 1))
                (push (p 2) primes))))

    (println "Sending request to nodes, and waiting ...")

    ; machines could be on different IP addresses.
    ; For this test 5 nodes are started on localhost
    (set 'result (net-eval '(
        ((nodes 0 0) (nodes 0 1) (format program 0 99999 1))
        ((nodes 1 0) (nodes 1 1) (format program 100000 199999 2))
        ((nodes 2 0) (nodes 2 1) (format program 200000 299999 3))
        ((nodes 3 0) (nodes 3 1) (format program 300000 399999 4))
        ((nodes 4 0) (nodes 4 1) (format program 400000 499999 5))
    ) 20000 idle-loop))

    (set 'primes (sort (flat primes)))
    (save "primes" 'primes)

    (exit)
</pre>

<p>At the beginning of the program a <tt>nodes</tt> list structure
contains all the relevant node information for hostname and port.</p>

<p>The <tt>program</tt> calculates all prime numbers in a given
range. The <tt>from</tt>, <tt>to</tt> and <tt>node</tt> variables
are configured into the program text using <tt>format</tt>. All
instructions are placed into a <tt>begin</tt> expression block, so
only one expression result will be send back from the remote node.</p>

<p>Many other schemes to configure a <tt>net-eval</tt> parameter list 
are possible. The example shows, that <tt>net-eval</tt> evaluates
the node parameter specifications inside the quoted list. The following
scheme would give the same resuls:</p> 

<pre>
    (set 'node-eval-list '(
        ((nodes 0 0) (nodes 0 1) (format program 0 99999 1))
        ((nodes 1 0) (nodes 1 1) (format program 100000 199999 2))
        ((nodes 2 0) (nodes 2 1) (format program 200000 299999 3))
        ((nodes 3 0) (nodes 3 1) (format program 300000 399999 4))
        ((nodes 4 0) (nodes 4 1) (format program 400000 499999 5))
    ))

    (set 'result (net-eval node-eval-list  20000 idle-loop))
</pre>

<p>The function <tt>idle-loop</tt> aggregates all lists of primes
received and generates the following output:</p>

<pre>
    192.168.1.100:4711
    192.168.1.101:4711
    192.168.1.102:4711
    192.168.1.103:4711
    192.168.1.104:4711
</pre>

<p>As with the previous examples all IP numbers could be replaced
with <tt>"localhost"</tt> or any other host-name or IP number to test a distributed 
application on a single host before deployment in a distributed environment 
with many networked hosts.</p>

<h3>Transferring files to and from remote nodes</h3>

<p>Files can be read from or written to remote nodes with the same functions
used to read and write files to a local file system. This functionality is
currently only available on UNIX systems when talking to newLISP servers. As
functions are based on standard <tt>GET</tt> and <tt>PUT</tt> HTTP protocols
they can also be used communicating with web servers. Note that few Apache
web-server installations have enabled the <tt>PUT</tt> protocol by default.</p>

<p>The functions <tt>read-file</tt>, <tt>write-file</tt> and <tt>append-file</tt>
can all take URLs in their filename specifications for reading from and
writing to remote nodes running a newLISP server or a web-server:</p>

<pre>
    (write-file "http://127.0.0.1:4711//Users/newlisp/afile.txt" "The message - ")
    &rarr; "14 bytes transferred for /Users/lutz/afile.txt\r\n"

    (append-file "http://127.0.0.1:4711//Users/newlisp/afile.txt" "more text")
    &rarr; "9 bytes transferred for /Users/lutz/afile.txt\r\n"

    (read-file "http://127.0.0.1:4711//Users/newlisp/afile.txt")
    &rarr; "The message - more text"
</pre>

<p>The first two function return a message starting with the numbers of bytes
transferred and the name of the remote file affected. The <tt>-read-file</tt>
function returns the contents received.</p>

<p>Under all error conditions an error message starting with the characters
<tt>ERR:</tt> would be returned:</p>

<pre>
    (read-file "http://127.0.0.1:4711//Users/newlisp/somefile.txt")
    &rarr; "ERR:404 File not found: /Users/newlisp/somefile.txt\r\n"
</pre>

<p>Note the double backslash necessary to reference files relative to root on the server
node.</p>

<p>All functions can be used to transfer binary non-ascii contents containing zero
characters. Internally newLISP uses the functions <tt>get-url</tt> and <tt>put-url</tt>,
which could be used instead of the functions <tt>read-file</tt>, <tt>write-file</tt> and
<tt>append-file</tt>. Additional options like used with <tt>get-url</tt> and <tt>put-url</tt>
could be used with the functions <tt>read-file</tt>, <tt>write-file</tt> and
<tt>append-file</tt> as well. For more detail see the newLISP function reference for these
functions.</p>


<h3>Loading and saving data from and to remote nodes</h3>

<p>The same <tt>load</tt> and <tt>save</tt> functions used to load program or LISP data
from a local file system can be used to load or save programs and LISP data from or
to remote nodes.</p>

<p>By using URLs in the file specifications of <tt>load</tt> and <tt>save</tt> these
functions can work over the network communicating with a newLISP server node.:</p>

<pre>
    (load "http://192.168.1.2:4711//usr/share/newlisp/mysql5.lsp")

    (save "http://192.168.1.2:4711//home/newlisp/data.lsp" 'db-data)
</pre>

<p>Although the <tt>load</tt> and <tt>save</tt> functions internally use <tt>get-url</tt> and 
<tt>put-url</tt> to perform its works they behave  exactly as when used on a local file system, 
but instead of a file path URLs are specified. Both function will timeout after 60 seconds if 
a connection could not be established. When finer control is necessary use the functions 
<tt>get-url</tt> and <tt>put-url</tt> together with <tt>eval-string</tt> and <tt>source</tt> 
to realize a similar result as when using the <tt>load</tt> and <tt>save</tt> in HTTP mode.</p>

<h3>Local domain UNIX sockets</h3>

<p>newLISP supports named local domain sockets in newLISP server mode and using the built-in functions <tt>net-eval</tt>, <tt>net-listen</tt>, <tt>net-connect</tt> together with the functions <tt>net-accept</tt>, <tt>net-receive</tt>, <tt>net-select</tt> and <tt>net-send</tt>.</p>

<p>Using local domain sockets fast communications between processes on the same file system and with newLISP servers is possible. See the Users Manual for more details.</p>

<a name="http_mode"></a>
<h2>22. HTTPD-only mode, newLISP as a webserver</h2>

<p>In all previous chapters the <tt>-c</tt> server mode was used. This mode can act as
a <tt>net-eval</tt> server and at the same time answer <tt>HTTP</tt> requests for serving
web pages or transfer of files and programs. The <tt>-c</tt> mode is the preferred mode
for secure operation behind a firewall. newLISP also has a <tt>-http</tt> mode which works
like a restricted <tt>-c</tt> mode. In <tt>-http</tt> mode only <tt>HTTP</tt> requests are
served and command-line like formatted requests and <tt>net-eval</tt> requests are not answered.
In this mode newLISP can act like a web server answering HTTP <tt>GET</tt>, <tt>PUT</tt>, 
<tt>POST</tt> and <tt>DELETE</tt> requests as well as <tt>CGI</tt> requests, but additional
efforts should be made to restrict the access to unauthorized files and directories to secure
the server when exposed to the internet.</p>

<p>When newLISP server answers any kind of requests (<tt>HTTP</tt> and command line), the newLISP 
function <tt>command-event</tt> can be used to pre-process the request. The pre-processing function 
can be loaded from a file <tt>httpd-conf.lsp</tt> when starting the sever:</p>

<pre>
    server_args = httpd-conf.lsp -http -w /home/node
</pre>

<p>The above snippet shows part of a <i>xinetd</i> configuration file. A startup
program <tt>httpd-conf.lsp</tt> has been added which will be loaded upon invocation
of newLISP. The <tt>-c</tt> options has been replaced with the <tt>-http</tt> option.
Now neither <tt>net-eval</tt> nor command-line requests will be answered but only
HTTP requests.</p>

<p>The startup file could also have been added the following way when starting the
server in the background from a command shell, and <tt>httpd-conf.lsp</tt> is in
the current directory:</p>

<pre>
    newlisp httpd-conf.lsp -http -d 80 -w /home/www &amp;
</pre>

<p>All requests will be pre-processed with a function specified using
<tt>command-event</tt> in <tt>httpd-conf.lsp</tt>:</p> 


<pre>
;; httpd-conf.lsp
;;
;; filter and translate HTTP request for newLISP
;; -c or -http server modes
;; reject query commands using CGI with .exe files

    (command-event (fn (s)
        (local (request)
            (if (find "?" s) ; is this a query
                (begin
                    (set 'request (first (parse s "?")))
                    ; discover illegal extension in queries
                    (if (ends-with request ".exe")
                        (set 'request "GET /errorpage.html")
                        (set 'request s)))
                (set 'request s))
            request)
))
; eof
</pre>

<p>All CGI requests files ending with <tt>.exe</tt> would be rejected and the 
request translated into the request of an error page.</p>

<h3>CGI processing in HTTP mode</h3>

<p>On <a href="http://www.newlisp.org">http://www.newlisp.org</a> various CGI
examples can be found. In the download directory at 
<a href="http://www.newlisp.org/downloads">http://www.newlisp.org/downloads</a>
two more complex applications can be found: <tt>newlisp-ide</tt> is a  web based IDE
and <tt>newlisp-wiki</tt> is a content management system which also runs the 
<a href="http://www.newlisp.org">www.newlisp.org</a> website.</p>

<p>The following is a minimum CGI program:</p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp

    (print "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n")
    (println "&lt;h2&gt;Hello World&lt;/h2&gt;")
    (exit)
</pre>

<p>newLISP normally puts out a standard <tt>HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n</tt> response
header plus a <tt>Server: newLISP v. ...\r\n</tt> header line. If the first line of
CGI program output starts with "Status:" then newLISP's standard header
output is suppressed, and the CGI program must supply the full header by
itself. The following example redirects a request to a new location:</p>

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/newlisp
    (print "Status: 301 Moved Permanently\r\n")
    (print "Location: http://www.newlisp.org/index.cgi\r\n\r\n")
    (exit)
</pre>

<p>A newLISP installation contains a module file <tt>cgi.lsp</tt>. This module
contains subroutines for extracting parameters from HTTP GET and POST requests,
extract or set cookies amd other useful routines when writing CGI files. See
the modules section at: 
<a href="http://www.newlisp.org/modules/">http://www.newlisp.org/modules/</a>.</p>

   
<h3>Media types in HTTP modes</h3>

<p>In both the <tt>-c</tt> and <tt>-http</tt> HTTP modes the following file types are
recognized and a correctly formatted <tt>Content-Type:</tt> header is sent back:</p>

<blockquote>
<table class="list" width="50%" summary="media types">
<tr align="left"><th>file extension</th><th>media type</th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.html</td><td class="left">text/html</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.htm</td><td class="left">text/htm</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.css</td><td class="left">text/css</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.gif</td><td class="left">image/gif</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.png</td><td class="left">image/png</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.mp3</td><td class="left">audio/mpeg</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.wav</td><td class="left">audio/x-wav</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.mpg</td><td class="left">video/mpeg</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.mov</td><td class="left">video/quicktime</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.avi</td><td class="left">video/x-msvideo</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.pdf</td><td class="left">application/pdf</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.js</td><td class="left">application/javascript</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">.zip</td><td class="left">application/zip</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>any other</em></td><td class="left">text/plain</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size="-1">media types in newLISP HTTP request handling</font></p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Environment variables set</h3>

<p>When receiving HTTP requests newLISP server mode will extract information from the HTTP request header and configure <tt>HTTP_HOST</tt>, <tt>HTTP_USER_AGENT</tt> and <tt>HTTP_COOKIE</tt> in the environment of the host operating system. If a <tt>httpd-conf</tt> functions was loaded on newLISP server startup header processing will happen after processing <tt>httpd-conf</tt>. The environment variables can be accessed by a CGI process.</p>

<h2>23. Extending newLISP</h2>

<p>newLISP has an import function, which allows importing function from DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) on Win32 or shared libraries on Linux/UNIX (ending in .so).</p>

<p>This chapter shows how to compile and use libraries on both, Win32 and Linux/UNIX platforms. We will compile a DLL and a Linux/UNIX shared library from the following 'C' program:</p>

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
    
    int foo1(char * ptr, int number)
    {
    printf("the string: %s the number: %d\n", ptr, number);
    return(10 * number);
    }
    
    char * foo2(char * ptr, int number)
    {
    char * upper;
    printf("the string: %s the number: %d\n", ptr, number);
    upper = ptr;
    while(*ptr) { *ptr = toupper(*ptr); ptr++; }
    return(upper);
    }
    
    /* eof */ 
</pre>

<p>Both functions foo1 and foo2 print their arguments, but while foo1 returns the number multiplied 10 times, foo2 returns the uppercase of a string to show how to return strings from 'C' functions.</p>

<h3>Compile a shared library on Linux/UNIX/MacOSX</h3>

<p>On Linux/UNIX we can compile and link <tt>testlib.so</tt> in one step:</p>

<pre>
    gcc testlib.c -shared -o testlib.so
</pre>

<p>Or On Mac OSX/darwin do:</p>

<pre>
    gcc -bundle -o testlib.so
</pre>

<p>The library <tt>testlib.so</tt> will be built with Linux/UNIX default <em>cdecl</em> 
conventions. Importing the library is very similar on both Linux and Win32 platforms, 
but on Win32 the library can be found in the current directory. You may have to specify 
the full path or put the library in the library path of the os:</p>

<pre>
     newLISP v.8.4.3 on Linux, execute 'newlisp -h' for more info.
    
    &gt; (import "/home/newlisp/testlib.so" "foo1")
    foo1 &lt;6710118F&gt;
    
    &gt; (import "/home/newlisp/testlib.so" "foo2")
    foo2 &lt;671011B9&gt;
    
    &gt; (foo1 "hello" 123)
    the string: hello the number: 123
    1230
    
    &gt; (foo2 "hello" 123)
    the string: hello the number: 123
    4054088
    
    &gt; (get-string (foo2 "hello" 123))
    the string: hello the number: 123
    "HELLO"
    &gt;    
</pre>

<p>Again, the number returned from <tt>foo2</tt> is the string address pointer and 
get-string can be used to access the string. When using get-string only character up 
to a zero byte are returned. When returning the addresses to binary buffers different 
techniques using unpack are used to access the information.</p>

<h3>Compile a DLL on Win32</h3>

<p>DLLs on Win32 can be made using the MinGW, Borland or CYGWIN compilers. This example 
shows, how to do it using the MinGW compiler.</p>

<p>Compile it:</p>

<pre>
    gcc -c testlib.c -o testlib.o
</pre>

<p>Before we can transform <tt>testlib.o</tt> into a DLL we need a <tt>testlib.def</tt> declaring the exported functions:</p>

<pre>
    LIBRARY    testlib.dll 
    EXPORTS
        foo1 @1 foo1
        foo2 @2 foo2
</pre>

<p>Now wrap the DLL:</p>

<pre>
    dllwrap testlib.o --def testlib.def -o testlib.dll -lws2_32
</pre>

<p>The library <tt>testlib.dll</tt> will be built with default Win32 <i>stdcall</i> conventions. The following shows an interactive session, importing the library and using the functions:</p>

<pre>
     newLISP v.8.4.3 on Win32 MinGW, execute 'newlisp -h' for more info.
    &gt; (import "testlib.dll" "foo1")
    foo1 &lt;6710118F&gt;

    &gt; (import "testlib.dll" "foo2")
    foo2 &lt;671011B9&gt;

    &gt; (foo1 "hello" 123)
    the string: hello the number: 123
    1230

    &gt; (foo2 "hello" 123)
    the string: hello the number: 123
    4054088

    &gt; (get-string (foo2 "hello" 123))
    the string: hello the number: 123
    "HELLO"

    &gt;
    ; import a library compiled for cdecl
    ; calling conventsions
    &gt; (import "foo.dll" "func" "cdecl")
</pre>

<p>Note that the first time using <tt>foo2</tt> the return value 4054088 is the memory 
address of the string returned. Using get-string the string belonging to it can be 
accessed. If the library is compiled using <em>cdecl</em> calling conventions, the 
<tt>cdecl</tt> keyword must be used in the import expression.</p>

<h3>Using data structures in imported libraries</h3>

<p>Just like 'C' strings are returned using string pointers, 'C' structures can be 
returned using structure pointers and functions like <tt>get-string</tt>, 
<tt>get-int</tt> or <tt>get-char</tt> can be used to access the members. The 
following example illustrates this:</p>

<pre>
    typedef struct mystruc 
       {
       int number;
       char * ptr;
       } MYSTRUC;
    
    MYSTRUC * foo3(char * ptr, int num )
       {
       MYSTRUC * astruc;
       astruc = malloc(sizeof(MYSTRUC));
       astruc-&gt;ptr = malloc(strlen(ptr) + 1);
       strcpy(astruc-&gt;ptr, ptr);
       astruc-&gt;number = num;
       return(astruc);
       }
</pre>

<p>The newLISP program would access the structure members as follows:</p>

<pre>
    &gt; (set 'astruc (foo3 "hello world" 123))
    4054280

    &gt; (get-string (get-integer (+ astruc 4)))
    "hello world"

    &gt; (get-integer astruc)
    123
    &gt;
</pre>

<p>The return value from <tt>foo</tt> is the address to the structure <tt>astruc</tt>. 
To access the string pointer, 4 must be added as the size of an integer type in the 
'C' programming language. The string in the string pointer then gets accessed using 
get-string.</p>

<h3>Unevenly aligned data structures</h3>

<p>Sometimes data structures contain data types of different length than the normal 
CPU register word:</p>

<pre>
    sruct mystruct 
       {
       short int x;
       int z;
       short int y;
       } data;
    
    struct mystruct * foo(void)
       {
       data.x = 123;
       data.y = 456;
       data.z = sizeof(data);
       return(&amp;data);
       }
</pre>

<p>The <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> variables are 16 bit wide and only z takes 32 bit. 
When a compiler on a 32-bit CPU packs this structure the variables x and y will each fill up 
32 bits instead of the 16 bit each. This is necessary so the 32-bit variable z can be 
aligned properly. The following code would be necessary to access the structure members:</p>

<pre>
    &gt; (import "/usr/home/nuevatec/test.so" "foo")
       foo &lt;281A1588&gt;

    &gt; (unpack "lu lu lu" (foo))
       (123 12 456)
</pre>
<p>The whole structure consumes 3 by 4 = 12 bytes, because all members have to be aligned 
to 32 bit borders in memory.</p>

<p>The following data structure packs the short 16 bit variables next to each other. 
This time only 8 bytes are required: 2 each for <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> and 4 bytes 
for <tt>z</tt>. Because <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are together in one 32-bit word, 
none of the variables needs to cross a 32-bit boundary: </p>

<pre>
    struct mystruct 
        {
        short int x;
        short int y;
        int z;
        } data;
    
    struct mystruct * foo(void)
       {
       data.x = 123;
       data.y = 456;
       data.z = sizeof(data);
       return(&amp;data);
       }
</pre>

<p>This time the access code in newLISP reflects the size of the structure members:</p>

<pre>
    &gt; (import "/usr/home/nuevatec/test.so" "foo")
       foo &lt;281A1588&gt;

    &gt; (unpack "u u lu" (foo))
       (123 456 8)
</pre>

<h3>Passing parameters in library calls</h3>

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" width="95%" summary="parameter passing in library calls">
<tr><th>Data Type</th><th>newLISP call</th><th>C Function call</th></tr>
<tr><td><em>integer</em></td><td><tt>(foo 123)</tt></td><td><tt>foo(int number)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>double float</em></td><td><tt>(foo 1.234)</tt></td><td><tt>foo(double number)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>float</em></td><td><tt>(foo (flt 1.234))</tt></td><td><tt>foo(float number)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>string</em></td><td><tt>(foo "Hello World!")</tt></td><td><tt>foo(char * string)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>integer array</em></td><td><tt>(foo (pack "d d d" 123 456 789))</tt></td><td><tt>foo(int numbers[])</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>float array</em></td><td><tt>(foo (pack "f f f" 1.23 4.56 7.89))</tt></td><td><tt>foo(float[])</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>double array</em></td><td><tt>(foo (pack "lf lf lf) 1.23 4.56 7.89)</tt></td><td><tt>foo(double[])</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>string array</em></td><td><tt>(foo (pack "lu lu lu" "one" "two" "three")))</tt></td><td><tt>foo(char * string[])</tt></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<br>

<p>Note that <em>floats</em> and <em>double floats</em> are only passed correctly on x86 platforms 
with <em>cdecl</em> calling conventions or when passed by pointer reference as in variable argument
functions, i.e: <em>printf()</em>.</p>

<p><tt>pack</tt> can receive multiple arguments after the format specifier in a list too:</p>

<pre>
    (pack "lu lu lu" '("one" "two" "three"))
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Extracting return values from library calls</h3>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" width="95%" summary="extracting values from library calls">
<tr><th>Data Type</th><th>newLISP to extract return value</th><th>C return</th></tr>
<tr><td><em>integer</em></td><td><tt>(set 'number (foo x y z))</tt></td><td><tt>return(int number)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>double float</em></td><td>n/a - only 32bit returns, use double float pointer instead</td><td>not available</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>double float ptr</em></td><td><tt>(set 'number (get-float (foo x y z)))</tt></td><td><tt>return(double * numPtr)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>float</em></td><td>not available</td><td>not available</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>string</em></td><td><tt>(set 'string (get-string (foo x y z)</tt></td><td><tt>return(char * string)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>integer array</em></td><td><tt>(set 'numList (unpack "ld ld ld" (foo x y z)))</tt></td><td><tt>return(int numList[])</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>float array</em></td><td><tt>(set 'numList (unpack "f f f" (foo x y z)))</tt></td><td><tt>return(float numList[])</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>double array</em></td><td><tt>(set 'numList (unpack "lf lf lf") (foo x y z)))</tt></td><td><tt>return(double numList[])</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>string array</em></td><td><tt>(set 'stringList (map get-string (unpack "ld ld ld" (foo x y z))))</tt>
</td><td><tt>return(char * string[])</tt></td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p><em>Floats</em> and <em>doubles</em> can only be returned via address pointer references.</p>

<p>When returning array types the number of elements in the array must be known. 
The examples always assume 3 elements.</p>

<p>All pack and unpack and formats can also be given without spaces, but are 
spaced in the examples for better readability.</p>

<p>The formats <tt>"ld"</tt> and <tt>"lu"</tt> are interchangeable, but the 16-bit formats 
<tt>"u"</tt> and <tt>"d"</tt> may produce different results, because of sign expansion 
from 16 to 32 bits.</p>

<p>Flags are available for changing endian byte order during <tt>pack</tt> and <tt>unpack</tt>.</p>

<h3>Writing library wrappers</h3>

<p>Sometimes newLISP's built-in import facility cannot be used with a library. This
happens whenever a library does not strictly adhere to <em>cdecl</em> calling
conventions expecting all parameters passed on the stack. E.g. when running Mac OS X
on  older PPC CPUs instead of Intel CPUs, the OpenGL libararies installed by default on
Mac OS X cannot be used.</p>

<p>A special wrapper library can be built to translate <em>cdecl</em> conventions
expected by newLISP into the calling conventions expected by the target library.</p>

<pre>
   /* wrapper.c - demo for wrapping library function */

   compile:
       gcc -m32 -shared wrapper.c -o wrapper.so
   or:
       gcc -m32 -bundle wrapper.c -o wrapper.dylib

   usage from newLISP:

       (import "./wrapper.dylib" "wrapperFoo")

       (define (glFoo x y z)
           (get-float (wrapperFoo 5 (float x) (int y) (float z))) )

    (glFoo 1.2 3 1.4) =&gt; 7.8

   */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;


   /* the glFoo() function would normally live in the library to be
      wrapped, e.g. libopengl.so or libopengl.dylib, and this
      program would link to it.

      For demo and test purpose the function has been included in this 
      file
   */

   double glFoo(double x, int y, double z)
   {
   double result;

   result = (x + z) * y;
   
   return(result);
   }

   /* this is the wrapper for glFoo which gets imported by newLISP
      declaring it as a va-arg function guarantees 'cdecl' 
      calling conventions on most architectures
   */

   double * wrapperFoo(int argc, ...)
   {
   va_list ap;
   double x, z;
   static double result;
   int y;

   va_start(ap, argc);

   x = va_arg(ap, double);
   y = va_arg(ap, int);
   z = va_arg(ap, double);

   va_end(ap);

   result = glFoo(x, y, z);
   return(&amp;result);
   }

   /* eof */
</pre>

mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
<p><b>2. VERBATIM COPYING</b>
</p>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
<p><b>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</b>
</p>
<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
<p><b>4. MODIFICATIONS</b>
</p>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>A.</b> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if
any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a
previous version if the original publisher of that version gives
permission.
  </li>
  <li><b>B.</b> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or
more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the
modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of
the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if
it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
  </li>
  <li><b>C.</b> State on the Title page the name of the
publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
  </li>
  <li><b>D.</b> Preserve all the copyright notices of the
Document.
  </li>
  <li><b>E.</b> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
  </li>
  <li><b>F.</b> Include, immediately after the copyright
notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the
Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
the Addendum below.
  </li>
  <li><b>G.</b> Preserve in that license notice the full
lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the
Document's license notice.
  </li>
  <li><b>H.</b> Include an unaltered copy of this License.
  </li>
  <li><b>I.</b> Preserve the section Entitled "History",
Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title,
year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
  </li>
  <li><b>J.</b> Preserve the network location, if any, given
in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the
Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for
previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History"
section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
  </li>
  <li><b>K.</b> For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements"
or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in
the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
  </li>
  <li><b>L.</b> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the
Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
  </li>
  <li><b>M.</b> Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".
Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
  </li>
  <li><b>N.</b> Do not retitle any existing section to be
Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
Section.
  </li>
  <li><b>O.</b> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
<p><b>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</b>
</p>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements."
</p>
<p><b>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</b>
</p>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
<p><b>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</b>
</p>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
<p><b>8. TRANSLATION</b>
</p>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
<p><b>9. TERMINATION</b>
</p>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except
as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>
<p><b>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</b>
</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
