BUILD, CHECK and INSTALL
----------------

info or type:

NetBSD and Solaris/SunOS automatically.

to test the compiled newlisp executable do

  make check

then to install with superuser permissions in /usr/bin

  make install

or from a user account if the sudo command is available

  sudo make install

or to install in ~/bin (bin in home directory) without root permissions

  make install_home

a shared, dhynamic library: newlisp.so. newlisp.dylib and  newlisp.dll

The file configure is not required, but can be used to discover the
makefile the make utility would use. The file configure has been
included for compatibility with packageing/installing systems requiring
the autoconf/automake system which is *not* required to make newLISP.


MINIMUM INSTALL
---------------
Note that for a minumum install only the executable newlisp or newlisp.exe
in Win32 is necessary. 

On Mac OS X or other UNIX copy  newlisp to /usr/bin or to ~/bin and give
it executable permissions.
